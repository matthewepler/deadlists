So like... I would ask please... I'm sorry to take it away from you, but the few people who are dancing... whatever you have to do, do it in the next 2 minutes... get it on, get it off, and after 2 o'clock when the Man comes in we would ask you please... y'know... whatever you're gonna move, move it sitting down and then we can go on... so if anybody should ask you, 'Are you attending a dance?' you go: 'No, man, I'm attending a private party.' OK?\"  Carlin Reed: \"Flying High was Country Joe & the Fish's \"Dark Star\". It was the first track on their first album. There's an official CJ&F release \"Live!

It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes. It left my mind, crater of a mind..., what the hey. And the heat came round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day. I was skipping through the lilly fields, when I came across an empty space. It quivered and exploded, left a bus stop in its place. The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began.

Only Country Joe and the second Dead set were FM broadcast. Much of this show was used for Anthem of the Sun.  The cuts at the start of the first 3 songs of set 1 appear to be very brief - just the first few notes of each intro. China Cat Sunflower and the Eleven blend seamlessly together; evidence seems to imply that they were one and the same song during this period (see David Gans' interview with Robert Hunter in his book \"Conversations With the Dead,\" p.24). Lovelight contains a small splice/dropout at about 3:14. Many Set 1 tapes in circulation only include Dark Star thru Lovelight.  (1) After Lovelight: Weir: \"Thank you.\" Garcia: \"Uh, we have to...um...go for a while. We'll be back later on. Country Joe & the Fish are gonna...\" (tape cuts).  (2) Announcements preceding set 2: Announcer: \"...soon to have an album out (unintelligible), the Grateful Dead\" Garcia: \"Why, thank you. Thank you.\" (sarcastic) Weir(off-mic): \"Now for our next morbid selection...\" Garcia: \"Okay, we've got a few things to say before we get into the real thing of it, and that is that some friends of ours, Lavelle & tiffany, just had a kid.\" Lesh: \"Happy Lavelle.\" Garcia: \"Yeah, Happy Lavelle, and we'd like to dedicate (unintelligible)...and also...\" Lesh: \"Whole set, whole date, whole year...\" Garcia: \"And also, we respectfully dedicate this set to the memory of Neal Cassady.\" (audience cheers) Weir: \"And in particular this song.\" Lesh (talking over Weir): \"Ernie Bo-Peep, we hope, is listening.\" Weir: \"Ernie Bo-Peep.\" Lesh: \"Ernie Bo-Peep.\" Weir: (off-mic, counts off Cryptical intro)  (3) tape flip in Alligator jam appears to be the same one as is on copies from the older source.  (4) Midnight Hour cuts mid-jam at [6:02] on the SBD, significantly earlier than on copies from the old FM source. On those tapes, only the last few notes appear to be clipped, with the song timing [9:51] to that point. Some copies in circulation do have the continuation of the Midnight Hour encore patched in, after which the following announcement is made: \"Hey remember, we're all prisoners till everybody is free. So tomorrow come out to San Quentin - they need our support. One o'clock, or one-thirty, or two o'clock. Anytime around then. Country Joe and the Fish came here from New York tonight, uh, and so when they left it was about four o'clock their time (in the morning) and they got up at eight. They wanted to stay around, jam some more, but - uh - their gonna rest up and come out to San Quentin tomorrow - as well as the Dead, and some of the Airplane, and some of the other bands.\" Then the KMPX radio DJ then comes on and questions weather they will play some more, determines that they won't, and then says that the time is now twenty past two. The timing for this song needs to be updated to include the ending and the post-show banter.","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1968-02-14.sbd.bunjes.12939.shnf "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1968-02-14.sbd.douglas-cleef.2267.shnf "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1968-02-14.sbd.miller.89676.sbeok.flac16 "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1968-02-14.sbd.winters.89437.sbeok.flac16 "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd68-02-14.sbd.kaplan.15640.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"120 SB MSR->DAT->CDR, 90 FM (Set 2 only), sampled for Anthem of the SunMaster recording source(s): 10inch-8trk Master Reels@15ips","contributors":["David Sorochty "," David Minton "," Tim Anderson "," Scott Allan"," the Compendium Crew"," \"The Art Of Rock\" book p182"," Richard Pipes "," Adrian M.

I'd been to San Francisco and seen the Mime troupe in the park and the beautiful people in their 1890's garb. I'd hang out on the Sunset Strip. I didn't have a car. I found that I liked to hitchhike. I could always get a ride with a longhair. Longhair meant something. I wore cowboy boots or moccasins, striped t-shirts & love beads.  Flower Power was going to end the war. It was 1968, before the assassinations.  I went to the early show on Saturday as the guest of some ushers who were the parents of one of the guitarists in a band I was in. I was a young teen, my friend couldn't make it & I essentially was there alone all afternoon studying their amps & equipment until a hippie came over and politely asked if I was \"with the Grateful Dead family?\" it felt like my opportunity to run away with the circus.  When the show eventually started, I left my seat and stepped onto the edge of the revolving stage and enjoyed the concert from a few feet in front of them -- mesmerized. I remember Jerry smiling at me smiling at him eye-to-eye. I got \"in-to-it\" (and them) and in my budding brain, I felt like sometimes he was playing to me; I was vacuuming-in the energy like a little black hole.  I was impressed with every little detail; from the way their name was intricately stenciled on the speaker cabinets, to the little round buttons with hip slogans and anti-war sentiments written on the, and especially Pig Pen's menacing presence. He was the front man. Like a bonfire. It was all Pig Pen & Jerry Garcia to me. They were the kind of jamming band I wanted to be in.  They had an album in the record stores and I rode my bicycle over to the shopping center to get it. I still have it. I think it was mono with a sticker that was pasted over the word stereo. I played it for everyone who'd hold still but the record didn't capture their live magic. I was the only Grateful Dead fan I knew. A few years later, Workingman's Dead & American Beauty got some airplay when the Underground FM radio scene emerged. I'd go see them whenever I knew they were playing nearby. They always affected me somewhere deeply interior.  When Ron died, I thought it was the end of them. But they expanded to fill new vistas. A great band. Whenever I hear the first notes of Viola Lee Blues, or Good Mornin' Little Schoolgirl, or Morning Dew -- I'm there as eager as one of those baby geese you've seen in the classic psychology experiment -- \"imprinted\" onto another species; following the tortoise like it was its mamma.\"","downloadSources":[],"recordings":"None in circulation as of 2/02.","contributors":["Bryan Crawford "," David Sorochty "," Brian Pollard "],"caretaker":{"name":"David Sorochty","email":"skull_roses@yahoo.com"}},{"sets":[],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Melodyland Theatre","city":"Anaheim","state":"CA","date":"1968-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1960s/19680309.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"Not listed in DeadBase XI.

Garcia played his '52-early '53 Gibson Les Paul Gold top, plugged into maybe 6-8 Fender twin Reverb Amplifiers with 12\" JBL Speakers. He had an octopus chord going to all the inputs of the amps.

Tom's 3\" reels ran for about 15 minutes on a side. The other master from on-stage mics cuts in on the first few beats of Alligator and often circulates with a brief exchange between Jorma, Weir, and unknown others after Feedback concludes, in which Weir curses the working class and explains why the Dead will be late for their show at the Shrine Exhibition Hall later in the evening.

The setlist information was provided by Kenny Schachat, an eyewitness. Kenny attended the Early Show, and remembers that the Dead played only one set per \"show\". He says: \"I was at this show in the 4th row. Also, there was only one set at that Fillmore East early show. The Dead were the second of three bands on the bill. Headlining was the newly formed Jeff Beck Group with Rod Stewart on vocals on their first U.S. tour. They were great, too! I think the first group was Buzzy Linhart's band. I'm quite certain that Morning Dew was the first song or at least very early in the set, that the Cryptical > Other one > Cryptical > Caboose came after and was the bulk of the set, followed by one or two at the end. I'm less certain, but I believe they played Good Morning Little Schoolgirl. I'm certain that they did not play Lovelight. I'm pretty sure that they also did not play Saint Stephen.\" Since Kenny's memories of the Early Show conflict with the circulating tape it seems reasonable to assume that the tape is from the Late Show. Kenny also remembers that Jerry was playing the circa '56 black Gibson Les Paul Custom for this show.  Someone else who must have attended one of these shows has reported \"The first time we heard Dark Star was at the Fillmore East in the late 60's. It was the whole set.

Jim Powell: \"This is primal Dead, one of the best sets in circulation from any year. The \"space\" or \"feedback\" begins from a dead start - there is a second of silence beforehand. The 2:23 Saint Stephen jam following \"what would be the answer to the answer man\" is of unique ferocity. There are numerous Caution teases in Lovelight, and the shift from one to the other is almost imperceptible. After 9:00 into Lovelight much of the time Caution and Lovelight are happening simultaneously (shades of Chales Ives!). Jerry sounds the introductory Caution flourish pointedly at 10:06 but the band doesn't follow. He tries again much more emphatically at 10:32 and this time they round the corner. The tape cuts off with the beginning of the applause. This is an excellent job of early audience taping. The mics are quite close in and there's minimal audience noise. Unfortunately most circulating copies are high generation and many are somewhat hacked up. It is possible that to complete the set we are missing songs before the opening Space on the tape; otherwise this is perhaps tHE most hard core opening of any Dead set in the history of the band. It is possible that we are missing songs between Saint Stephen and Alligator, but the pause in the tape between these songs sounds like the pause-button pause between songs characteristic of early AUD tapes. It is improbable that there were more tunes following the concluding Feedback, unless there was an encore.  Dick Latvala has stated that no soundboard of this show exists in the vault. Says Dick, \"so stick with that audience, folks.\" (Dupree's Diamond News interview, vol. 27, 12/94, p.16).\"  Someone who must have attended one of these shows has reported \"The first time we heard Dark Star was at the Fillmore East in the late 60's.

In the first verse, Jerry sings: \"Dark star crashes, pouring its light into ashes. Reason tatters, the forces tear loose from the axis.\" and then, instead of \"Searchlight casting for faults in the clouds of delusion\" he sings: \"Glass hand dissolving... recedes in the nights of goodbye\". He realizes he's out in no man's land as he sort of trails off a bit while singing \"goodbye\". The next verse is: \"Shall we go, you and I while we can, through the transitive nightfall of diamonds?\" He sings \"transitive NIGHT fall of diamonds\" as if expecting Phil to hit the high harmonies, but realizing as soon as he sings \"night\" that no one's coming to the rescue.  (2) the fragment of Bill Graham's intro on Side B of the tape preceding Schoolgirl runs: \"...this whole thing, it's like 900 years old by now, the grateful Grateful Dead.\" The best, oldest copies of this recording have Bill Graham's intro before Schoolgirl at the beginning of Side B, and there is no splice between the intro & the tune. This insures that at least Side B (if not the entire tape) isn't from 8/28/68 at the Avalon at all! they did play at the Avalon on 8/28/68, but the venue for this recording would have to be the Fillmore West.

Previously, this show has circulated as both 10/9/68 and 10/10/68. In addition, this has circulated broken up into two parts, with the second half labeled as \"Set 1\" and the first half labeled as \"Set 2\". The split between the two \"sets\" came about 16 minutes into the jam before the Lovelight Jam. Although Casady sat in for three songs for the Jimi Hendrix Experience's 10/10/68 late show at Winterland, it has been concluded that the date for this is 10/10/68. Maybe he ran from one theater to the next? Bill Gadsen has confirmed this song order (the old tapes had the order reversed), that it's all one set, and stated that Peter Abram's reels were labeled as 10/10/68. These conclusions are supported by comments made by Dick Latvala. On page 26 of issue #34 (Summer 1996) of Dupree's Diamond News, Dick Latvala stated in an interview \"There's 10/10, and that's got songs like It's a Sin, a harp jam, a blues jam, a Dark Star Jam, Lovelight, Alligator, Death Don't Have No Mercy, and Dark Star\".  (1) with Paul Butterfield on harmonica. Bjorn Bergstrom, who collects Paul Butterfield live tapes doubts that the harmonica player on this show is Butterfield since the singing and playing, especially on Look Over Yonders Wall (a Butterfield Blues Band standard), doesn't sound like Paul Butterfield at all to him. He also points out that you can clearly hear Mickey asking a guy named Marvin to come up on stage and sing and play harmonica with the band. (2) very similar to New Potato Caboose. (3) starts very much like the post-drums portion of Alligator, and contains a brief, Spanish Jam-like theme. It also contains many hints of Caution (Do Not Stop on tracks). (4) cut here is likely quite small.","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1968-10-10.sbd.hollister-konstantin-hoelter.5186.shnf "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd68-10-10.sbd.miller-ladner.4513.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"180 SB Circulating recordings of the 1968 Matrix shows trace back to Bill Gadsden's reels.

Dick Latvala found the master reel in the vault of the complete set 2, which was not in circulation till recently. Dick has said that this is one of his favorites and he calls it \"primal Dead\". (1) Before Dark Star: Jerry says \"Hold onto your bodies and relax, everybody. Everybody relax for crissakes, everybody just cool it. Everything's gonna be alright.

Different versions of this show have one, or the other, or both of these pieces of banter. Some also have a KSAN announcer's lines spliced in as well. Dark Star: verse 1 at 4:28; Dark Star theme at 8:03; Climax at 10:30; Birth of a Star (a.k.a. Telstar) at 11:46; verse 2 at 13:24. After \"one man gathers what another man spills\" in Saint Stephen, Bobby says \"funniest thing I ever heard\". Death Don't: there is a neat splice at 0:12, right at beginning of first verse. (2) Jerry says \"We're gonna, uh, we're gonna just, uh, just stop for about five minutes, and uh, get our hands dry. and then we're gonna play some more. But, but in the meantime, you can do whatever you like, while we're, while we're waiting around.\" (3) the Drums following the 13 Jam ends with distinct Phil bomb (a la Other one).

Admission is a flat $2 per head. Children under 12 will be admitted free.  Al Bridges, an Indian leader who has led numerous fish-in protests at Frank's Landing near Olympia, will introduce the Dead.  Suzette Bridges, a vivacious and articulate young lady, will present the tribes' side of the fishing feud.  Backing the Dead will be the Bryon Pope Ensemble from Los Angeles, Easy Chair, Light, and Papa Bear. The Retina Circus light artists will provide illuminations.  Part of the funds from the benefit will be used to establish a bail fund for Indians and others arrested for allegedly illegal fishing. This year alone there have been 27 gillnetting arrests. Bail - formerly set at $250 - has been raised to $1000.  The Indians also must replace nets confiscated by the state. They cost between $60 and $100 apiece.  Some 40 persons, Indians and non-Indians, have established a communal colony at Frank's Landing on the Nisqually. Some live in teepees; others in tents and crude hogans. They contend that the Medicine Creek treaty of 1854 gave the Indians the right to fish in \"their usual and accustomed places\" for \"as long as the sun shall rise, the streams shall flow and the grass shall grow.\"  the state, on the other hand, claims the treaty is invalid and that the Indians must adhere to seasonal regulations.  The colony at Frank's Landing is seeking to re-tribalize, to return to the bounty of Nature. But it hasn't been easy. They've been tear-gassed, terrorized and hassled by citizenry and officialdom alike.  Now they've dug in for the winter. It promises to be a long, wet one.  Their choice of the Dead for Sunday afternoon's gig is an apposite one. The Dead more or less started the whole concept of group tribalization on a musical level. Beginning with Ken Kesey and his early Acid test prankstering, the Dead (originally called the Warlocks) have solidified under their chief, Gerry Garcia, as a sub-tribe with something to say - and the sound and talent to give their message a voice.

It was trashed by a fire sometime in 1970. It is not the same place as the Syndrome, where they played on 11/27/70. The setlist information was provided by Ron Ramsey, an eyewitness: \"I was at the 11/27-28/68 shows at Chicago's Kinetic Playground aka Electric theater. My memories of the setlists are quite sporadic, although, these being my first Live Dead shows, as I heard each tune for the first time, it was if another Veil of Illusion was being removed... like stumbling upon a Burning Bush and seeing the Face of God, or walking on a beach and finding the Seashell of Buddha. Those memories are indelibly etched forever. There might have been an initial opening band...but for certain Procul Harum preceded the Dead. While watching Procul from the edge of the dance floor, I noticed a guy in front of me with a long ponytail stuck down the back of his shirt. My God, it was Bob Weir! a lot of us tucked our hair away back then... this was, after all, 1968 Chicago--Mayor Daley's Cop Fiefdom - things did get a little hairy out there from time to time. I had the strongest impression that Weir was watching Procul Harum and thinking: \"Shit, we're better than these guys.\" Anyway, Weir opened the show on the 27th with a jolly: \"Happy turkey Day!\" it was thanksgiving. I know for sure they did: 'That's it For...The Other one' that first night, as I remember my jaw dropping when I heard the opening notes. Also on the 27th: Alligator. As for the rest of the songs, they did pretty much the standard repertoire for late 1968: Doin' that Rag, Dupree's, Dark Star > Saint Stephen > the Eleven > Lovelight, Feedback, etc. But other than the two mentioned, I cannot say which nights they did what. Sorry. (They did not, to my eternal regret, play New Potato Caboose either night... I never did get to hear that tune live.) Other factoids: Both nights were two set shows, with the Dead as the closing act. The Dead's amps all had tie-dye front covers. On the back of the amps was stenciled a white lightning bolt on red/blue background surrounded by the words: Spirit of Creation. I guess this was before the skull/bolt motif. A guess: about 200 people attended. Ah, the Old Days... I probably recall what they wore more clearly than the specific song order. T.C. had on one orange sock, and one green. Weir had on a belt with \"Bobby\" stitched in beads across the back. (At a later show, my friend showed Weir a photo he had taken of this, and Weir responded: \"Oh my God...the Bobby Belt.\") Jerry Garcia was wearing a woolen poncho. After the first night-first set, I stumbled upon Garcia off by himself near the refreshment stand. Compelled to say something to him, I ended up asking for clarification of lyrics I couldn't understand from Anthem. Jerry was very gracious. Anyway, I got to shake the hand that shook the Hand. One other anecdote: on the 2nd night, my same photographer friend, tripping, somehow found his way upstairs to the dressing rooms. He sat next to Weir, who was reading the Seed (our underground 60's Weekly). At some point he asked Lesh how he could get into the Road Crew. Lesh responded \"You just want a way to get to California.\" Then Lesh pointed to a huge heavy wooden table and said: \"If you can levitate that, you're in.\" Alas, my friend missed his Golden Opportunity.\"","downloadSources":[],"recordings":"None in circulation as of 2/02.","contributors":["Ron Ramsey "," DeadBase XI"," Brian Pollard "],"caretaker":{"name":"David Sorochty","email":"skull_roses@yahoo.com"}},{"sets":[],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Kinetic Playground","city":"Chicago","state":"IL","date":"1968-11-28T08:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1960s/19681128.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"The Kinetic Playground is the same venue as the Electric theater where they played in April of 1969.

The Eleven comes to a stop after the usual opening jam. Someone is heard saying \"Fade out\". Bobby explains they need to rearrange some things to correct an echoing problem. Bear suggests everyone on one side of the auditorium go over to the other side and vice versa.

What I remember about the Dead concert is absolute fascination at the music. The club was called the Catacombs in Houston, tx. Most of what was played was from Anthem of the Sun (That's it for the Other one, Cryptical Envelopment, etc. and a very good 'space jam' that came back into the album to finish). There was a second keyboard player, besides Pigpen, so this was probably Constanten. I also know for sure that Morning Dew was played mainly because it was my favorite from the first album), also I remember Garcia's introduction to the song '...let's get the old shit out of the way' and then the cymbals starting up Morning Dew... Schoolgirl was probably played but I'm not certain...
