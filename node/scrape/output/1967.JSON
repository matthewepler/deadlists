The video portion is intense to watch. Strob lights are flashing and the camera zooms in and out very fast on the band members. It appears that Mickey was not there. There is a lot of footage of people dancing (and the guy doing the oil-based light show). Looks like a great party!  Matt Schofield: there was a tV program called Whicker's World over here [UK] - starting sometime in the late 60s I should think. Maybe also aired in the US.  Can't remember it too well but I think it was the sort of program that could have had a 'look back at the SF 60s music scene in a patronising way' edition, but maybe I'm thinking of something else.  Seems a simple enough way though for the words 'Whicker's World' to get attached to the video, rather than trying to discover a venue of that name.  Tim Anderson: it was the studio version of GR overdubbed to the performance film.  David Sorochty: Whicker's World  Announcer #1: \"...ow night. The retrospective exhibition of her work opens at the Opera Grovener Galleries in London next week.\"  Announcer #2: \"An assault on the senses, an LSD trip without drugs. Flashing strobe lights, spermatazoic color.\"  the Golden Road which follows is just the version off the first album.  I don't have the video, just the audio. Someone can give it another look and see if it is apparent they are lip synching. I cued up my CD of the 1st album and the Whicker's World tape and they sound the same to me, though the Whicker's tape is much more grungy of course. BTW both of the announcer's voices sound British.","downloadSources":[],"recordings":"(5) Video.","contributors":["David Dieterich "," Matt Schofield "," Tim Anderson "," David Sorochty "," Alan Topal ."],"caretaker":{"name":"Teddy Goodbear","email":"teddy@goodbear.com"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"title":"Yonder's Wall","transition":";"},{"title":"I'm A King Bee"}]}],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Panhandle, Golden Gate Park","city":"San Francisco","state":"CA","date":null,"posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1960s/19670101.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"","downloadSources":[],"recordings":"Video (?).","contributors":["Teddy GoodBear "," The DeadHead's Taping Compendium vol. #1"," p.566 -- Michael M.

The 45 minute segment has never circulated in digital format till 2013, with the exception of the 6th take (the longest one) which is part of two compilations of miscellaneous studio and live material from 1967 (shn/flac sets 81259 and 85631). This practice session is now labelled as ??/??/67.  There are several reasons to conclude it was made before November 19, 1967 - in fact before August 5, 1967 (currently the \r\nearliest known live Lovelight). Most importantly, from the talking between takes it is clear they are working out the arrangement. Maybe this the first time they are playing it?  There is definitely only one drummer.  Pigpen sings it a bit differently; in fact he only sings the first verse, over and over.  The band doesn't have any backing vocals except the \"let it shine\" bit, which was dropped & never appears live.  The guitar parts are much simpler; on 8/5/67 they're a lot more complex & bouncy.  They don't have a transition after the first verse.  By 8/5/67 they have a smoother drum transition.  Garcia doesn't have his soloing down for this song at all, and doesn't seem to have worked out any part other than the chords.\r\n(1) dead air for about seven minutes, followed by about three minutes of \"let it shine\" vocal rehearsals.\r\n(2) Jerry: \"It should be loud because that's the melody you know. It should be out over the others.\"\r\n(3) Jerry: \"Let's go over it a time or two and get the arrangement. Hey Pig, do you want to do two verses and then into that uh drum business?  Well let's, let's decide that because that, that's uh...\"  Phil: \"Bring some more grub man.\"  Jerry: \"Ok that would be the stomp because...\"\r\n(4) How many verses do you want to go through on Lovelight?  I think two, two and then a drum thing. And then after, after the bridge come on back and start get back into Lovelight.  Play it man. And you'll have to play organ too. Give us a signal then, at the end. At the end, go back into the regular bar solo. Go back into the regular again. Go back into a regular verse at the end and go 'shine, shine, shine, let it shine'.\r\n","downloadSources":[],"recordings":"(45) SB.

Other artist(s): Jefferson Airplane, QMS, Country Joe & the Fish and the Charlatans\". *Charles Lloyd on flute on GMLS.  Transcribed by Glenn Gillis: Best of all were the glorious free concerts in the Panhandle -- a flatbed truck, makeshift electricity, food, wine, friends, sunshine, and some wonderful bands who hadn't hit the big time yet. At first it seemed amazing that we knew by name so many of the hundreds gathered; but as the months went by, our awareness of a larger community grew until it peaked that fine day in January of 1967, the day of the tribal Stomp at the Polo Fields to be known as the \"Human Be In.\"  We heard it through the grapevine, and a half dozen of us started early that morning to walk the couple of miles to the park. As we walked along Lincoln Avenue, we noticed other groups of neighbors walking in the same direction. More joined in off side streets, and by the time we turned north into the park, we were a large, laughing group. A half mile later, we were a horde and as the Be-In took shape through the day, we were awed and thrilled as the Polo Fields filled up with more than 20,000 people. It was a day of innonence and hope; and in many ways the last moments of naivete for a neighborhood that had just gone public. -- Rosie McGee from: Brandelius, Jerilyn Lee, \"Grateful Dead Family Album -- p40.

I listened carefully to that bit and here's what I got:  Midnight Hour (13.17) Viola Lee Blues# (4.10) instrumental version #Good Morning Little Schoolgirl (0.27) (with flute)  When I heard the flute on GMLSG I thought immediately of 1-14-67 and sure enough that's what it was, but just the tail end of the song. After checking the Viola Lee turned out to also be from 1-14-67, but just from the beginning up to the quick dropout in that song at the 4 minute 10 second mark. I have not really tried to figure out where the Midnight Hour comes from, but I suspect it will be duplication of something common.  I was fooled into thinking the Viola Lee was an unique instrumental version because it didn't have the end of the song which is the only place they sung the lyrics on 1-14-67. I hope this helps to clarify things for you if you come across this item.  Think quickly - where else is there a 13 minute 17 second Midnight Hour?  Teddy GoodBear: After listening to the rap in GMLSG, I'd say it's Lloyd with help from Pigpen. I've not heard Lloyd other than this recording, nor do I know what Lloyd's voice sounds like; as I'm just guessing. So I'm listing this entry as \"sounding like Lloyd\", unless somebody knows differently.","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd67-01-14.sbd.vernon.9108.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"(?)

Other artist(s): QMS.  To see the concert art: < http://www.pompano.net/~goodbear/concert_art/01_27-28_67.html >  Bart Wise: this show is an audience tape, not a soundboard. The break between Viola Lee Blues and Cold Rain and Snow sounds like a master tape pause, and nearby audience clapping is obvious between the songs. The vocals and organ are prominent in the mix and the guitar and drums are echoey and distant; this may indicate that the taper stood near a PA stack and a bit distant from the stage, thereby reducing the prominence in the mix of instruments which received less PA sound reinforcement. All instruments are audible and there is very little hiss.  There is some distortion on loud vocal and organ passages. Morning Dew cuts in on the first note of the song, so probably only one or two seconds is missing. New Potato Caboose fades out to about 2 seconds of silence before Viola Lee Blues fades in; these are clearly cuts that occurred sometime after the master was made.  About the date of this tape: my memory may not be exactly right, but I think this tape usually circulated as 1/28/67 until sometime in the 80's, when Deadbase started listing it as 1/27/67, at which point you started seeing it traded under that date. Under any circumstances, it has always seemed a little odd to me, a little too mature sounding and stretched out for my picture of what they were playing in the very beginning of 67. Despite the fact that there are too few tapes from that era to really make any conclusions about date from content, I decided to compare with other tapes with slightly more solid dates.  First, I think this is probably all from one show, rather than a compilation as Jim Powell suggested. The whole tape has the same sound and the same mix of instruments, and from my own experience audience taping, even with the same rig in the same hall it would be unusual to get such similar sounding recordings on different nights.  The chief point of inquiry was the version of Alligator. On 1/27/67, there is a drum intro and after the initial vocal section, the band proceeds straight into jamming without the intervening drum solo. After a few minutes of jamming, Garcia sings his \"Alligator runnin' round my door\" bit, which is followed by more jamming.  Comparing this with other versions, we find that on 5/5/67 (a shaky date itself), 8/4/67, and 9/15/67, Alligator is begun not with a drum intro but rather with a Garcia guitar intro. In all three versions, the band jumps into jamming after the vocals without a drum solo, and in all three versions Garcia does NOT sing \"Alligator runnin' round...\"  11/10/67 and 11/11/67, on the other hand, both start with a drum intro rather than the guitar intro. There is the signature drum solo after the initial vocals, and Garcia sings \"Alligator runnin' round...\" on both.  If I had to date the tape of 1/27/67 just on the basis of the above information, I would place it sometime in between 9/15/67 and 11/10/67. The three summer 67 Alligators are consistent with each other and different from both the \"1/27/67\" and 11/67 shows.  As for the Viola Lee Blues, at over 21 minutes it certainly seems different from versions on 11/29/66 (about 10 min), 8/4/67 (about 12 min), 9/15/67 (about 10 min, but cut), and even 11/10/67 (about 15 min, but cut.) Who could know, but it seems like it probably belongs later in the year.  \"1/27/67\" may be the right date, but it might also be a case of the taper later saying \"I think this was recorded at the Avalon in early 67.\" Perhaps we should note something like \"The date is slightly questionable; tape content suggests later in the year.\"  tim Anderson: I've always been of the opinion that the drum solo in Alligator didn't start until Mickey joined up. Needless to say, I have no evidence to back this up. Just a gut feeling, and the mythology of the alleged two-hour Alligator on his first show, seems to point in that direction.  David Sorochty: this tape sounds like an old audience tape, but with next to no audience noise. I believe this may be an audience tape that was recorded with the mics up high enough to eliminate crowd noise. That would be unusual for a tape this old.  Immediately after they finish Cold Rain and Snow you can hear a Schoolgirl tease for about two seconds before the tape cuts off.  I believe that DeadBase's comment that Alligator is uncertain does not mean that they are in doubt about its existence in this show, rather they mean that the general consensus is that Alligator was not played until later in that year, so Alligator throws doubt on the dating of this tape to January 1967.  Jim Powell: SET1 [78:17] Morning Dew [7:10] % New Potato Caboose [8:40#] % Viola Lee Blues [21:47] % Cold Rain and Snow [2:56] % drums [0:04] > Alligator [17:42] > Caution (Do Not Stop on tracks) [19:50] %  Most circulating copies of this tape require speed correction. This tape sounds like it was made with mics set up on the stage lip. The clapping (e.g. at the end of CRS) proves the tape was made with AUD mics. The minimal amount of audience noise proves the mics were placed way up front. The mix on the tape is the result of the mics' placement in relation to the various monitors on stage, plus the acoustic sound of the drums, plus the spillover from the PA stacks. Plainly these six tunes belong to the same show but it is not clear from the tape whether they belong to one set or two.  New Potato Caboose fades down at the end, probably close to its conclusion. DeadBase lists a Good Morning Little Schoolgirl following Caution but the tape of Schoolgirl [17:42] circulating mislabeled \"1/27/67\" with this date is actually from 4/9/70.  This tape used to circulate labeled \"1/28/67\" until DeadBase labeled the list \"1/27/67,\" noting that it might actually belong to 1/28 or 1/29.  Pigpen is of course the vocalist on Alligator.  The performances on this tape are so incendiary that it's hard to believe it comes from so early in the year, but it certainly comes from before Sept. 67, since the inimitable Mr. Billy the K is the one and only sole drummer on the tape. and actually, after listening again to 11/19/66, the strongest performance of 1966 circulating, I find it much easier to believe that the 1/27/67 tape could actually be dated properly.  I suggested that this tape was a \"composite\" because I remembered suspecting the Schoolgirl, and when I checked it just now, it was obvious that the Schoolgirl is an entirely different mix, even before I identified it as being in fact 4/9/70.  on the 4/9/70 Schoolgirl Pigpen tries to start the vocals 8 bars early, but quickly cuts himself short -- this is its easiest identifying mark. This tape of Fillmore West 4/9/70 also circulates with some bizarre chick wailing overdubbed in one channel, mislabeled \"Fillmore East 7/10/70.\"  Does anyone have a copy of the Avalon 1/27/67 tape with a version of Schoolgirl that seems to actually belong to 1/27/67?  After listening again to this tape I am inclined even more strongly to nominate it as the strongest performance of 1967 circulating. (Truth to tell, there isn't a lot of competition, however.)  I still suspect that 1/27 may in fact be a falsely dated composite of shows from later in the year, especially given the well developed Alligator > Caution. I don't know if we'll ever have a definitive answer regarding the source(s) for that tape, but it's probably worth noting that the date is uncertain for more than just the Alligator > Caution.  David Sorochty: I saw the posts on these shows and was kind of surprised, especially about 10/22 and 1/27. I say that since 10/22 is CD type quality soundboard and 1/27 is a grungy echoey aud tape, they don't sound anything alike. Maybe they are two different sources for the same show? Anything is possible with these old tapes I guess. So I'll sit down and do a careful comparison.  DeadBase X has this to add: \"This tape, which is of uncertain origin, also exists dated as 1/24/67, 1/28/67 and part of 2/12/67. Keep in mind that some sources claim Alligator was not performed until June.\"It's been confirmed that the segment Morning Dew [#6:54] ; [0:01] New Potato Caboose [8:25#] ; [0:02] is actually from 10/22/67","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1967-01-27.sbd.8762.shnf "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd67-01-27.aud.hanno.16744.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"(?)

This tape was in circulation for years before the complete 11/19/66 became available. There is some reverb at the beginning of High-Heeled Sneakers which must have been added later since it is the 11/19/66 performance, which does not have the reverb.  Jim Powell: All tapes circulated marked with this date are mislabeled. High Heel Sneakers, Cold Rain and Snow, and Smokestack Lightning are all 11/19/66; the Smokestack Lightning > King Bee is Studio 67.  Teddy GoodBear: While it may be true that all tapes marked with this date are mislabeled, I have a Smokestack Lightning that I got in the late 70's marked \"2/12/67\". I'm not able to tell whether it is a studio or show version, but it definetly is NOT 11/19/66. It also seems to end without going into anything; as being not the same as below (??/??/67) \"Smokestack Lightning > I'm a King Bee\" entry. I agree with the few that believe Smokestack being played in 1966 was too early!  Teddy GoodBear later goes on to say: My Smokestak tape (which sounds very slow) is as follows -  Bob Weir Interview* [1:20] (talks about Mime troupe billed as GD formally the Warlocks, Bill Graham calling Billy K. for advice & Bill Graham is the one with the clipboard at the trips Festival). *Where is this from? If anybody has the rest of this interview, let me know.  Smokestack# [to 9:41#]  Now, I'm not sure if it's different than 11/19/66. It may be the same as Jim said. Being so slow it's hard to tell. I didn't. remember the cut I had, but there is a cut none the less. Perhaps someone with pitch control can speed it up & compare it to the 11/19/66 one.","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd67-02-12.sbd.theotherwayne.18124.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"(?)

These were the days when rock radio stations were programmed by people who actually knew and loved music, rather than the accountants and marketing analysts who now control the airwaves. During this time it was possible to hear, in a single program, music by artists as diverse as the Beatles, Ravi Shankar and Miles Davis, to name but a few, picked and played by DJs who spoke to, rather than at, their audience. One of the pioneering stations in this adventurous era of radio was KMPX-FM in San Francisco, which was instrumental in letting the world know about the explosion of great music in the Bay Area in the late 60s. \r\n\r\nOne fine April evening in 1967, the station's co-founder, the legendary Tom \"Big Daddy\" Donahue, invited Phil Lesh and Jerry Garcia to play guest DJ on his nightly KMPX show. Phil and Jerry discussed the Grateful Dead's then-brand-new debut album (they promised the next one would be much better!), as well as such arcane topics as a top-secret military project to develop a \"sound gun\" that could kill or maim everyone for miles around with super-low-frequencies. Best of all, they brought along some of their favorite records to play on the air. As you might expect, it was a most unpredictable batch of tunes indeed. \r\n\r\nThe following is a playlist from Phil and Jerry's guest DJ shift, as broadcast on KMPX-FM in San Francisco, sometime during the last week of April, 1967. \r\n\r\nDisk 1 [69:23]\r\n[Missing] SWAN SILVERTONES - (Song title unannounced)\r\n01.

Other artist(s): the Wildflower and QMS.  Bart Wise: (The cut in Cream Puff War is a VERY minor dropout and occurs in the first couple of seconds of the song.)  Now I am no longer sure whether \"Walkin' Blues\" should be included in the database. It is clearly a faked-up piece where someone has spliced segments of Quicksilver playing the song together with segments of the Grateful Dead playing the song:  Jim Murray singing, Cipollina playing Pigpen singing, Garcia playing Jim Murray singing, Cipollina guitar solo Pigpen harp solo, Garcia guitar solo Quicksilver finish the song.  The cuts are carefully done, and this might be how KPIX-TV broadcast the piece. The sound quality is similar to the version of Cream Puff War. I couldn't find the other version of Grateful Dead doing \"Walkin' Blues\" (from 1966) to compare with this one, if I even have it. Finally, if it helps with dating the tape, the Quicksilver web site lists October 1967 as the month Jim Murray left the band.  David Sorochty: there is an interview already in progress that the tape cuts in on. Jerry is talking about Cream Puff War and says that it is the only song for which he has completely written the whole thing himself. There is some indecipherable talk about \"the words\", so maybe he means that he only wrote all the lyrics himself. Phil pipes up and is heard briefly and others are heard giggling in the background. The interview lasts only 24 seconds and then they go to play the song. The Cream Puff War that follows is 3 minutes and 44 seconds long.  Yeah - I know what you're thinking. There are some stories about them going on the Maze show and lip synching a song. I've even seen a picture from that tV appearance where Phil I believe, was holding a broom instead of his bass to mock out the whole lip synch thing. So I thought that even though this didn't sound like the version on the 1st album at all, it would be worth a check since if it is kind of grungy, and as it turns out this is a much longer version than the one on the LP and they *definitely* are not the same.  So - if this was from that tV show, maybe they recorded the audio there for the tV show and they just lip synched it later? Is it possible that this is from another tV appearance where they didn't lip synch or maybe from a radio program? Who knows? I guess I always just presumed that when they lip synched on the Maze show it was to a song off the 1st LP.  David Sorochty continues: Walkin' Blues which I called 1966 and we now are saying might be from 1967 \"Maze tV\" show.  Well the version I call ??/??/66 on my web site is indeed the same version of this song which switches back and forth between the Dead and QMS.  Here is what I have come up with:  it starts out with QMS playing the song, at 27 seconds it switches to the Dead playing it, at 50 seconds it switches to QMS, at 1 minute and 27 seconds it switches to the Dead, at 1 minute and 59 seconds it switches QMS, who finish it out to a total time of 2 minutes and 14 seconds.  If this is from a tV broadcast it would be really cool to see a video of this since the picture would have been switching back and forth in sync with the audio!  Jim Powell: the interview cuts in on Garcia laughing with announcer talking about Ralph J. Gleason. Interview tape with Gleason following, who introduces Jerry & asks him \"what kind of music does the Grateful Dead play. Jerry answers \"loud,\" and continues by saying that they play \"dance music.\" in response to a question about their sources Jerry says that they are \"clever thieves.\" Later Jerry talks about playing feedback: \"If you ignore it it just gets louder and louder.\" The interview concludes with Jerry introducing Cream Puff War and saying that he wrote it.  Here's a listing of my copy of this tape, which is certainly lo gen though perhaps still not entirely complete (see below).  The Maze tV Show, KPIX-TV, San Francisco 4/8/67. Total time [19:06 +]. The Wildflowers: \"Crying in the Background\" [3:40; title is a guess]  Interviews with Ralph Gleason and with Garcia, Weir & Lesh [4:55]. This is the interview snippet where Jerry identifies the Dead as \"clever thieves.\"  Grateful Dead: Cream Puff War [3:51]  the tape here contains a scrap of the announcer's voice left from a cut. Perhaps it's only commercials that were cut, together with the announcer's 'and now let's return ...'. See below, however.  Quicksilver Messenger Service: Pride of Man [3:42] Quicksilver Messenger Service: Walkin' Blues [2:23] Announcer: concluding remarks [fade down at 0:23]  Somewhere I've seen or heard Ralph Gleason quoted during this period remarking that even when San Francisco bands perform the same song, they play it differently; he gives as his example the Dead's and Quicksilver's different handling of Robert Johnson's Walkin' Blues. During his concluding remarks the announcer seems to refer to this comment. Perhaps it appeared in a passage of the show cut between Cream Puff and Pride of Man, or between Pride and Walkin' Blues. It seems less likely that the show also included a performance of the tune by the Dead.","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd67-04-08.tv.hanno.12623.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"(?)

Song order is speculation by Teddy GoodBear, based on the late 70's tape and cuts.  Jeff Tiedrich: No way this is 9/29/67, which is where Deadbase moved this list for Vol 9. Their contention is that this is the famous Mickey's first show falls apart when you hear the entire tape. Alligator comes to a definite conclusion and is no way part of the infamous two-hour Alligator/Caution.  David Sorochty: the info in Deadbase about 5/5/67 really being 9/29/67 is not so of course. The song order I have is:  Dancin' Golden Road > New Potato Alligatior He Was a Friend of Mine  Alligator starts and comes to a complete finish, so all the talk of a two hour long Alligator (for the show on this tape at least) is not possible. The info listed in Deadbase saying Alligator---> Caution is obviously wrong then too.  Teddy GoodBear: on my older tape that I got in the late 70's -  He Was a Friend of Mine# [4:24] #Stage Banter [:50] Jerry: \"...We're stalling...corn plaster on his bass drum\" > Golden Road [1:58] Bob: \"This one is for Laughlin\" > Caboose# [6:48]  on my newer tape that I got in the 80's -  #Stage Banter [2:08] Jerry: \"...We're stalling...corn plaster on his bass drum\" > Golden Road [2:11] Bob: \"This one is for Laughlin\" > Caboose [9:14] Alligator [11:00] He Was a Friend of Mine# [5:06]  What's DeadBase's logic? Does anybody hear Mickey on the tape? I don't. So if there is no Mickey then the tape has to be before 9/29/67 or whenever Mickey was out of the band during the early 70's. I'll go along with labeling it, \"circulates as 5/5/67, but date is uncertain\".  As I said, I got my older copy around the late 70's from a NY trader who had a lot of \"Fillmore\" tapes in his collection. He told me the date & said it was from the Fillmore. Assuming we believe it's from the Fillmore, that narrows down the date quite a bit.  and if you look at these songs, they fit in with the other \"timeframe wise\" dates these songs were being played. If I came into this cold without any dates attached to this tape, I would say based upon other setlists that this was 3/19/67, 4/12/67 or 5/5+6/67.  Christian Crumlish, his unedited review some of which was published in \"The DeadHead's taping Compendium vol. #1\":  05/05/67, Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, California [stage banter], the Golden Road > New Potato Caboose, Alligator, He Was a Friend of Mine//  the tape itself came to me mislabeled as a \"Fillmore West Acid test 02/06/67.\" Not only was there no Acid test on that date, but there was no Fillmore West in 1967 either. It probably got called an acid test along the way because of the trippy stage banter, labeled on my original as \"The Effects of Vitamin A.\" My first copy of this was an audience tape but a soundboard is now available. Some tapes have the He Was a Friend of Mine first (before the chatter), but the soundboard shows that it clearly comes after Alligator.  Here's a transcript of what's said on stage before the Golden Road:  --tuning sound--  ?: Wheeeeeew  Bob and others: aaaaghh, urrrghhh, etc.  Jerry: We're stalling. We're stalling while our uh drum-- I'll tell you tell you exactly what's going on up here so nobody has to wonder anymore.  Bob?: Lay it on me. [\"on\" pronounced \"own\"]  Jerry: What's going on is our drummer is putting a uh corn plaster on his bass drum.  Phil?: He is lifting his left thumb....  Jerry: that's what's happening.  --bass drumming and cheers, organ notes--  Bob: OK now this is a drop-out song and as far as you all are drop-outting, dance dance dance....  ?: waauugh!  ?: Did somebody say \"waaaugh!\"?  ?: waaaaeghh  Bob: Everybody say \"waaaa!\"  ?: Waaaagh!  Bob: thank you--  Jerry: Gosh  Pigpen: Let me hear everybody say \"fuck!\"  audience (weakly): Fuck!  Jerry (languid): Louuuder.  Bob: Everybody say \"dope\"  audience: dope!  Jerry: awww  Bob: Everybody say \"primate\"  ??: What?  Jerry: Say what?  Bobby: Oh yeah? ... Everybody say \"What?\"  audience: What!  ??? (goober voice): Whut?  Jerry: Hey that was good that was good.  Phil: Everybody say \"Ohhh noooo!\"  audience: No!  Pig (singing): t'ain't nothing 'a me...  --golden road starts--  Here are some glimpses into the personalities of the members of the band:  Bobby tends to take things to an abstracted level, his cry of \"primate\" is not taken up and leaves even the other band members puzzled. Phil's suggestion seems to be based on the sound that people sometimes make when they're tripping too hard. Pig's contribution is more earthy and natural.  The hippie attitude without the intellectual pretensions. Jerry, back when he still spoke from the stage, is actually filling in the audience on what's going on upstage, in a small way leveling the barrier between performer and fans.  The Golden Road is energetic and over quickly, segueing neatly into New Potato. (Bobby says something like \"This one if for Laughlin\" before launching into the first verse.  Highlights: the Golden Road, Bobby's inarticulate lysergic insight that we're all primates.

[Caption: tHIS IS tHE O'KEEFE?]  the normally staid O'Keefe Centre - a hotbed of toronto culture - took on a mod look last night as young hippies danced in the aisles to the music of the Jefferson Airplane, a rock group in the San Francisco style. Later 300 youths danced on the stage as three groups jammed for 50 minutes. Story, photo on page 19.  from p.. 19....  \"Kids dance in the O'Keefe's aisles\"  By VOLEMAR RICHTER Star staff writer  Marty Balin smiled with delight as he looked over the 300 people dancing on the O'Keefe Centre stage last night. and just for fun he acted out the fear on Hugh Walker's face when the whole thing started.  Balin's group, the Jefferson Airplane, rock 'n' roll exponents of the San Francisco hippie-freedom, got the kids dancing in the aisles in a joyous freewheeling happening.  Ushers frantically tried to return them to their seats because, after all, other paying customers might want to see and besides that sort of thing just isn't done at the O'Keefe.  \"Disregard the ushers,\" the leader of one of the three rock groups on the bill shouted. Hundreds of them did and that's what bothered Walker, the Centre's managing director.  Hasty  Over at the side, he had a hasty discussion with Bill Graham, the San Francisco dance hall baron and producer of the show. Graham pointed out that the crowd was peaceful and happy and wouldn't think of tearing up those soft seats or anything else.  \"Let's just say it turned out all right,\" he said afterward, a few minutes before disappearing into a back room for more discussions with five grey-suited O'Keefe managers.  Most of the near sellout crowd last night just watched. Dozens more sat out in the lobbies discussing the whole thing over a few more cigarettes.  But maybe 300 others danced to a pounding, driving, throbbing and oozing trip of sound and color supplied by three bands.  and two light shows. Here's how it happened.  Appetizer  Before the opening dim of the lights, the three screens on stage were already giving an appetizer.  Centre screen carried the encircled, upside-down Y peace symbol, its colors slowly changing; green on blue, blue on two greens, tan on green and yellow. This screen was filled by Headlights, a group that adds the visual impact to the rock 'n' roll shows at Graham's Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco.  They work with liquid projections - colored oils swirled on a dish and projected - and rotating color wheels and loops of live-action film.  At stage right and left were two extra screens carrying color projection by a New York group called Sensefex Inc. Their work involves the projection of paint-splotch slides, electric motors that twirl the whole thing around. A movie projector showed its contents through a chute of angled mirrors that was also rotated by a motor.  Hippies  on the screens the multi-hued splotches revolved slowly forming a kaleidoscope resembling some protoplasm. Its colors were hard and deeply defined; white Headlights projected soft, gentle colors like early morning.  The audience was liberally sprinkled with hippies - in army shirts and commando hats, in beads and capes, and even in ties and jackets.  First  Band: toronto's Luke & the Apostles. started off with their hard blues-rock sound. Lead singer Luke (Gibson) hugged the microphone crooner-style as he belted out \"My Soul.\"  the peace symbol started dripping colors and eventually melting away shapelessly under the liquid colors that were applied above it. Bizarre globes turned green, red and back to green and ended like a red sky with stars.  The Apostles. did two standard blues, \"You Can't Judge a Book By Looking At the Cover\" and \"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl,\" both in a tough, heavy lumbering tone, filled with science-fiction and monster noises that were interesting to hear but out of place.  \"Schoolgirl\" was also done by the next group, the Grateful Dead, but in a looser, freer version, and in the Chicago blues form it came from. It was symbolic of the free music the group plays. They take it easy and put in their improvisations naturally.  That characterizes both the Jefferson Airplane and the Dead, the latter lesser known and less inventive. But the Dead are the true spokesmen for the San Francisco hippie scene and former resident musicians with the LSD trips Festivals run by novelist Ken Kesey.  (They also have an album that its Canadian distributor can't keep in stock, though the Dead have had no radio hits).  Leader Jerry Garcia's group doesn't have as much substance as the Airplane, but they work together as precisely as parts of a machine. Two-hundred-pound Pig Pen (Ronald McKernan) gives a happy undertone to the music, while Phil Lesh plays complex bass.  No effort  it took the Jefferson Airplane, after intermission to get the dancing started. The taped sounds of a jet heralded their arrival. The group fills to stage front with Grace Slick's torchy vocal, \"Somebody to Love.\"  the Airplane captured that crowd without effort. The quality of their music, its intelligence and imagination superimposed on the necessary beat, drew them out to experience total involvement with sound and color.  This music appeals to the older rock 'n' roll lovers. The young kids can't dance with the tempo transitions. The older ones do a free-form, improvised dance  Leader Balin, sings in a clear voice. Grace booms and lashes out with hers. Guitarist Jorma Kaukonen puts substance into the group's improvisations, while Jack Casady puts down a solid bass line. Spencer Dryden adds excitement with his drums, and Paul Kantner plays guitar, and sings.  They project the spontaneity freshness of youth. Their music is alive, and communicates clearly despite its complex arrangements and structure.  After the concert-dance, another dance occurs right on stage. This one planned as all three band jam for a straight 50 minutes.","downloadSources":[],"recordings":"","contributors":["Jeff Tiedrich "," Malcolm O'Brien"," Teddy GoodBear "," Adrian M.

Unfortunately Lovelight cuts off just as it was getting into a pretty heavy jam. Before Beat it on Down the Line'uh-hum' is said jokingly several times by several band members and then Bobby says 'good PA'. Jerry says 'twelve' and they begin Beat it on Down the Line (with twelve beats of course).  The vocals to the Other one on this tape are the earliest known and go like this:  When I woke up this morning, my head was not intact. I asked my friends about it, try to find out where it's at. A wind came up inside of me, blew the dust clouds all away. The heat came 'round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day.

Jeff Tiedrich: \"There's a bit of a mystery here. The Alligator>Caution that appears on both the 11/10/67 and 11/11/67 tapes are identical -- even on the vault reels! it is unknown which of the two dates these songs belong to, but it's not unreasonable to presume that 11/10 is the original and 11/11 is the copy. The best explanation (read: speculation) is that someone copied the 11/10/67 Alligator>Caution onto the end of the 11/11/67 reels. The master reels for these two shows were not originally in the Dead's vault -- they were stored at Warner Brothers, which is presumably where all this mysterious copying took place.\"  Jim Powell: \"The introduction preceding Schoolgirl features Jerry suggesting people use the time between songs to order a pizza, take off their clothes, get high, hoot and jeer at the performers.\"  David Sorochty: \"There is another Cryptical-->Other one--->Cryptical sequence on the Shrine '67 tapes currently listed as being from the 11/10/67 show, which definitely is not duplication of the other one (i.e. The 11/11/67 version). The two versions have slightly different lyrics. It is not duplication of any other version in circulation. Maybe they did play it both nights. If more information comes to light about this sequence and its correct date, then its status may change. This is another mystery about these tapes.  These are the lyrics of the version identified as from 11/10/67:  '...two, three, four' Cryptical Envelopment > that's it For the Other one  I woke up this morning, my head was not in sight. I would ask the walls about it, but they vanished overnight. I could not think or spell my name, or fly their words away. The heat came round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day.  Comin', comin', comin' around... etc.  Escapin' through the lilly fields, when I came across an empty space. It quivered and exploded, left a bus stop in its place. Well a bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began. There was Cowboy Neal, at the wheel, of a bus to never-ever land.  Comin', comin', comin' around... etc.  Cryptical Envelopment  Jerry: 'thank you'  David Sorochty and Teddy GoodBear: these shows originally circulated together out of order on two cassettes labeled as '11-8,9-67' and as '11-10,11-67', however they only played two dates - the 10th and the 11th. Some tapes have the studio versions of Born Cross-Eyed and Dark Star which we list under 11-14-67 (see below) and others do not. When the studio songs are there, they are at the beginning of the side which continues with it Hurts Me too from 11-10-67. To confuse things, some of the tapes in circulation have sides a and B reversed compared to others. Both copies of Feedback usually are cut off by the end of the tape sides, although our timings listed come from copy which does not get cut.

Jeff Tiedrich: \"There's a bit of a mystery here. The Alligator>Caution that appears on both the 11/10/67 and 11/11/67 tapes are identical -- even on the vault reels! it is unknown which of the two dates these songs belong to, but it's not unreasonable to presume that 11/10 is the original and 11/11 is the copy. The best explanation (read: speculation) is that someone copied the 11/10/67 Alligator>Caution onto the end of the 11/11/67 reels. The master reels for these two shows were not originally in the Dead's vault -- they were stored at Warner Brothers, which is presumably where all this mysterious copying took place.\"  David Sorochty: \"There is another Cryptical-->Other one--->Cryptical sequence on the Shrine '67 tapes currently listed as being from the 11/10/67 show, which definitely is not duplication of the other one (i.e. The 11/11/67 version). The two versions have slightly different lyrics. It is not duplication of any other version in circulation. Maybe they did play it both nights. If more information comes to light about this sequence and its correct date, then its status may change. This is another mystery about these tapes.  These are the lyrics of the version identified as from 11/11/67:  Cryptical Envelopment > the Other one  Well I woke up this morning, with the sky in sight. I would ask the walls about it, but they vanished overnight. I could not think to spell my name, I find there was no way. The heat came round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day.  Comin', comin', comin' around... etc.  I was dancing through the lilly fields, when I came across an empty space. Quivered and exploded, left a bus stop in its place. A bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began. There was Cowboy Neal, at the wheel, of a bus to never-ever land.  Comin', comin', comin' around... etc.  Cryptical Envelopment  David Sorochty and Teddy GoodBear: these shows originally circulated together out of order on two cassettes labeled as '11-8,9-67' and as '11-10,11-67', however they did only play two dates - the 10th and the 11th. Some tapes have the studio versions of Born Cross-Eyed and Dark Star which we list under 11-14-67 (see below) and others do not. When the studio songs are there, they are at the beginning of the side which continues with it Hurts Me too from 11-10-67. To confuse things, some of the tapes in circulation have sides a and B reversed compared to others. Both copies of Feedback usually are cut off by the end of the tape sides, although our timings listed come from copy which does not get cut. Other songs also can get cut on one person's tape and not on another's. Beat it on Down the Line is not on these cassettes, but reportedly is on other tapes of these shows. It's apparent that there are several different transfers from reels to cassettes in circulation. They are very confusing to say the least.  The first tape usually came labeled as '11/8&9/67'.

In those days I used to hang out in the East Village and as an Xmas present to myself, I bought a sitar from this store on E 9th St called the House of Musical traditions. By the time the owner had given me a free lesson, it was near or after 8pm and I realized that I wouldn't have time to drop off my new instrument and still make it over to the Village theater (later the Fillmore East) to catch the early show with the dead. Ticket prices at the Village in those days were $2.50, 3.50 and 4.50 and the seats in the pit were removed for dancers, so you could pay 2 and a half bucks to hang out and dance in front of the folks with the $4.50 tickets.  This didn't help me any as I had only pocket change after my big purchase. I had seen the Dead 3 times previous, twice at the Cafe Au Go Go and in tompkins Sq Park back in june, so of course I had to go to both shows tonight. On the way over to the gig, I bumped into a couple of friends who didn't have any money either and decided it was too cold to hang on the Street and they'd come along to the show. I could've walked an elephant down 2nd Avenue that night and gotten less attention than my sitar, which I was carrying over my shoulder. Seems everybody heard of them but never saw one up close. Must've shown it off to a dozen people who stopped me along the 3 block walk to the theater.  When we got there, we found a few more folks who also had a desire to see the band and a lack of money. No Problem, we say. Follow us. On 6th St., there was this door that was open and you went up a flight of stairs, if you took a right you were at the East Village Other offices and if you took a left, you were in this room full of circuit breakers, went through a door and were in the foyer of the ladies room in the balcony. This was a well known secret among some of us locals and we had caught a fair number of free shows this way. I guess somebody discovered that the door was unlocked, as tonight it was locked tight. Disaster.  Back down to 6th st., pull down the ladder to the fire escape for the balcony and head on up in hopes of getting somebody inside to pop the door. Not only no luck, but we got the distinct feeling that this old fire escape was going to come down if we hung out much longer. After a hasty retreat, we are at our wits end. Short of storming the gate (which we weren't into), it seems that we are left out in the cold, so to speak.  Things were looser in those days, esp when it wasn't crowded, so the 6 or so of us duck into the lobby to warm up and see if we could con the lone ticket taker. I notice him looking at my sitar so I immediatly sit down about 6 feet from him and start to strum. Over he comes. \"Farout man, a sitar!\", etc. Over his shouolder I see my co conspiritors walking into the theater. He suddenly remembers he's working and turns around to catch the action and goes running after them. Job done, i sling my instrument over my shoulder and walk right in. I don't think he tried too hard, as I saw most everybody who walked in during the course of the evening. No, I don't remember the set list, only that Pig did a bitchin Schoolgirl and at the end of the first show one of the band said if we wanted to stay for the late show we were welcome to, and another one (Weir?) said \"yeah we didn't sell any tickets for that one either.\"  Anybody out there at that show? Anybody remember taking part in our \"creative\" gatecrashing? BTW, in my 28 years almost to the day of seeing the Dead, 6/67-6/95, that was the only time I ever crashed the gate. I did see the guy i conned later that evening and he just looked at me smiled and shook his head, so i guess he was more impressed with our creativity than pissed about our getting in.
