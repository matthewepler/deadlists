This list used to include a King Bee, the Rub and Lovelight, from a SB 30 tape, but they have been moved to a separate ??/??/71 entry. This list also used to include an Uncle John's Band encore, but it has been removed since it was not on David Lemieux's list, and it did not have timings from the tape. Jim Powell says ``These lists [the ones with timings] derive from the [90] minutes of SBD now circulating from this show. These tapes are plainly incomplete and there was also a NRPS set. The tapes circulate in [two] pieces: a) a 45-minute side containing China Cat through Casey Jones and Morning Dew through Second that Emotion; b) a 45-minute side containing Good Lovin through Uncle John [...]. China Cat through Casey Jones is the 1st set conclusion. [ ... ] After Bertha there is a longish pause during which, among other shenanigans, Phil announces \"Alright all you wise guys write your requests on your girlfriends' bosoms and send 'em up here.\" The Set 2 list looks more nearly complete. The tape of Second that Emotion breaks off [...].'' thayer Jennings says \"Second that Emotion cuts off with a significant portion missing. Splice in Sing Me Back Home, with perhaps 8 seconds missing (accounted for in timing). Splice in Not Fade Away (#1), with approximately 4 seconds missing (accounted for in timing).\"","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1971-04-25.sbd.bertha.ashley.96096.dvda "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1971-04-25.sbd.matera.113038.sbeok.flac16 "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1971-04-25.sbd.miller.95625.sbeok.flac16 "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1971-04-25.sbd.vernon-minor.30886.sbeok.flac16 "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd71-04-25.sbd.grote.8761.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"90 SBD.","contributors":["Thayer Jennings"," Jim Powell"," Bob Murphy"," D.

Set breaks are best guess at this point.  Actual venue is unknown\r\nA Note About Dick's Pick 35: The Legend of the Houseboat Tapes:\r\nAlthough the Grateful Dead's vault is enormous and impressively full, the band certainly doesn't have a tape of every show it played; in fact, they don't even have a copy of every show they recorded. Tapes drifted off in a variety of ways - including Jerry Garcia handing them out. And therein lies the story of Dick's Picks 35.\r\n\r\nThis spring, our archivist David Lemieux got a call from Donna Jean Godchaux-Mackay. It seems that in the late summer of 1971, just before Keith Godchaux began rehearsals with the Dead, Garcia handed him a big box of tapes and said, \"Here, this is our most recent tour. Learn our music.\" The irony was that Donna Jean doubts mightily Keith ever bothered to listen to them - he'd never listened to the Dead all that much before he auditioned, first with Garcia and then the rest of the band - he just had an uncanny innate facility for the music. In any case, he left the tapes on his parents' houseboat in Alameda, CA, and there they stayed. For almost 35 years.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 2005, Keith's brother Brian and son Zion were cleaning out the houseboat, found the tapes, and gave them to Donna, whose jaw dropped. One call to Lemieux later, and the Dead's long-lost missing tour from the summer of 1971 had resurfaced. Master tapes include April 28 and 29 at the Fillmore East (released as \"Ladies and Gentlemen,\" which was mixed from the multi-track masters), the 7/31 Yale Bowl (alas, the reels were blank), a small piece of the second Hollywood Palladium show, the complete shows from Berkeley Community Theatre 8/14 & 8/15, and others. Dick's Pick #35 is the complete San Diego (8/7/71) show, all that was salvageable of the 8/24 Chicago show, and an hour-plus of the Hollywood Palladium (8/6), which is all that existed on the tapes.\r\n\r\nNot a soundboard-recorded note of that tour's music circulates among Dead Heads, so this is a truly remarkable find. How they survived 35 years in a watery environment simply proves, yet once again - if you needed convincing - that God smiles on the Grateful Dead.\r\n","downloadSources":[],"recordings":"SBD: 2 CDs","contributors":["Kevin Weil"],"caretaker":{"name":"John Oleynick","email":"johno@john.rutgers.edu"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"duration":"5:43","title":"Bertha","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:09","title":"Me And My Uncle","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:13","title":"Mr. Charlie","transition":";"},{"duration":"6:08","title":"Sugaree","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:03","title":"El Paso","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:26","title":"Big Railroad Blues","transition":";"},{"duration":"4:58","title":"Big Boss Man","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:20","title":"Brokedown Palace","transition":";"},{"duration":"4:28","title":"Playing In The Band","transition":";"},{"duration":"7:16","title":"Hard To Handle","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:29","title":"Cumberland Blues","transition":";"},{"duration":"6:31","title":"Loser","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:53","title":"The Promised Land"}]},{"number":2,"songs":[{"duration":"3:#56","title":"Truckin'","transition":">"},{"duration":"3:35","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"16:40","title":"The Other One (1)","transition":";","commentRef":"1"},{"duration":"5:39","title":"Me And Bobby McGee","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:45","title":"Sugar Magnolia (2)","transition":";","commentRef":"2"},{"duration":"5:27","title":"Not Fade Away","transition":">"},{"duration":"10:47","title":"Goin' Down The Road Feeling Bad","transition":">"},{"duration":"3:14","title":"Not Fade Away"}]},{"number":"encore","songs":[{"duration":"3:30","title":"Johnny B.
