These tapes have been in circulation since the 70s.  The longer tape begins with the Dark Star and cuts just as they are starting the transition bridge out of Dark Star ; copies in circulation are quite degraded SBD and sometimes circulate labeled AUD.  The shorter fragment contains the last 12:54 of the Dark Star and is rather less degraded than the other tape, but still considerably.  T.C.'s keys insure the '69 date.  The 1st vocals start at 6:44 and finish at 7:43, and they never really go into space afterward, marking this Dark Star as early summer 69 at the latest, but it is definitely somewhat after Live Dead.  Riffs resembling Sputnik occur around 12:20.  2nd vocals start at 18:34 and conclude at 19:29.  The longer tape breaks off 0:09 after the conclusion of the 2nd vocals ; the shorter fragment continues for another 0:22 to the end of the transition bridge, and then cuts.  Latvala was unable to identify this tape.  My best guess is Winterland 5/3/69.","downloadSources":[],"recordings":"19:39 SB  12:54 SB","contributors":["Jim Powell"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Fillmore West","city":"San Francisco","state":"CA","date":"1969-01-02T08:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1960s/19690102.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"This information according to Book Of The Dead Heads and DeadBase IX.

It's very hard to say where one song ends and the next begins. (1) it sounds as though maybe Set 1 ended with Lovelight and this Jam with some chanting is what was happening on stage between the sets. There is an unknown guest guitarist on the part listed under Set 2. The last 34 min initially circulated separately with some copies having more of the audience at the end than others. It sounds like it might not be the end of the show. This also circulates as 8/29/68, due to misreading Dick's handwriting on a tape box. Some circulating CDRs have the Other one Jam cut and others are complete. Some CDRs have the tracks split differently also. A ticket for this show is in the Art of Rock and it says \"Carousel Ballroom \"Soul Scene\" Benefit Dance for the Blackman's Free Store, Weds. June 19 7:30pm, Admission ticket, $1.50 advance, $2.00 at door\". Listed as performing are Richie Havens and the Grateful Dead.Book Of The Dead Heads and DeadBase IX list the Dead at Fillmore West on this date.  According to some reports the Dead performed at an event called the \"Celestial Synapse\" which took place on this date at Fillmore West.  They may have played Dark Star.There is tape in circulation with this date, labeled \"Garcia, Nelson & Wakefield, the Matrix, San Francisco 2/19/69,\" 90 SBD reels, but it is not Grateful Dead and (probably not Wakefield either).

There are probably several minutes of music missing in the tape break in the first set.  This cut comes early to be a reel flip ; if it is on the master there must have been some mishap with the taping.  Jerry plays slide on Hard To Handle.

There are brief cuts in the SBD at 0:31 into the 2nd Jam in 8s and again at 1:48.  The first of these cuts comes about 45 minutes into the set and probably represents a reel flip.  There is a cut in Caution at 8:01 ; some vocals are lost here and the tag end of the vocals seems to fade down, making this resemble an edit and raising the question of what's on the vault copy.

There are two SBD masters of this show -- reels and cassettes.  One master has 6 minutes cut from the Cryptical reprise ; the other master (or circulating copies) cuts in just after the beginning of The Other One and runs unbroken through to the conclusion of the set.  Between them, the two masters contain the complete show.  Composites circulate, but also many partial combinations and unpatched fragmentary versions of That's It For The Other One.  Collector beware.The Eleven analyzes:  St. Stephen > 1st vocals 1:06 > transition Jam 2:25 > Eleven Jam 3:21 > Eleven vocals 0:42 > Eleven Jam 2:53 > 2nd theme Jam 1:41 > transition 0:48 > Turn On Your Love Light.SBD of parts of this show have circulated for years, sometimes mislabeled \"Family Dog 8/29/69.\"  About an hour of FM excerpts were broadcast in the early 90s.  Copies of one of the masters only emerged recently and optimal complete composites are finally beginning to circulate.Rob Bertrando writes:  \"The partial reel master of 6/5/69\" is plagued by 'scrape flutter.'\"  Eaton's list reads:06/05/69 The Fillmore West, San Francisco Ca - complete  4.3, 139min, Sbd, A1D0, Cass M->Cass  1->Dat  0, 48k,  Ampex C-90 Master Cass/no dolby->Tascam 122mkIII Cass 1st Gen->3800 x 0NOTE ON FILLMORE WEST JUNE '69Introducing Me & My Uncle on 6/869 Garcia says \"We have to split.  Jr. Walker's gonna come on, and the Glass Family again, and we'll be back for a second set later on, so everybody hang around, and we're gonna end up with this little short tune.\"  This implies that the sequence of sets on Sunday ran:  Glass Family, Dead, Jr. Walker, Glass Family, Dead.It's impossible to tell for sure from the circulating tapes whether the Dead played 2 sets every night, whether we have any of the Dead's portions of these shows complete on tape besides the 5th, or how much we might be missing.It does appear that we have the whole, or very nearly, of 6/5/69, in 151 minutes of tape, as two 75 minute sets.What we have of 6/7 is all one set, likely the complete set, timing 95 minutes.  If the structure of the show on the 7th was as on the 5th & 8th, there should have been another Dead set on the 7th, another hour of music plus or minus, and what we have must be the 2nd set.  Of this putative 1st set we have no trace on tape, and apparently there is none in the vault.  So maybe there was only one Dead set on Saturday.6/8 is also fairly clear, consisting of the phenomenal 47-minute first set plus a second set during which Jerry and Pigpen sit out the first 45 minutes and then close with a rather lackluster That's It > Cosmic Charlie, a total of just 120 minutes of music, but very plausibly the whole of a laid-back Sunday show at the end of a party-hard weekend.6/6 is the most puzzling case, with its 80 minutes of circulating tape (Eaton lists 88 minutes).  Garcia does not play on any of the material listed in Set 1.Jeff Cotsman suggests that 6/6 is the show McNally mentions at this venue in '69 where Jerry was too dosed to play.  If this is the case then maybe we should also consider whether the Lovelight circulated as \"6/6/69\" in fact belongs to 6/8/69, and the Lovelight listed as 6/8/69, without Garcia or Pigpen and with Bishop and Ceballos, as well as the two Ceballos tunes, in fact belong to 6/6.","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1969-06-05.sbd.barbella.6017.shnf "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd69-06-05.sbd.cotsman.15204.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"120 SB reels  50 FM  139 SB cassetteMaster recording source(s): Ampex C-90 Master Cass/no.dolby","contributors":["Jim Powell   Eric Doherty  Nathan Wolfson  Dick Latvala  Michael Goetz  Rob Eaton  Rob Bertrando  Jeff Cotsman"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"title":"[1:19:06]","transition":";"},{"duration":"12:29","title":"Smokestack Lightning","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:54]","transition":";"},{"duration":"4:13","title":"Green Green Grass Of Home","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:00","title":"Me And My Uncle","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:03]","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:06","title":"Checkin Up On My Baby","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:32]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:37","title":"Beat It On Down The Line","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:04]","transition":"%"},{"duration":"48:22","title":"Turn On Your Love Light"}]}],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Fillmore West","city":"San Francisco","state":"CA","date":"1969-06-06T07:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1960s/19690606.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"Elvin Bishop plays guitar on the tunes listed in Set One.

A review by Peter Goddard in the Toronto Telegram for Wed. July 9, 1969 refers to performances of Casey Jones and Morning Dew.  These tunes were probably from the Early Show.  In the Toronto Star Jack Batten notes that the early show opened with two country tunes, the rest of the set consisting of a variety of blues, more country, and \"numbers reminiscent of San Francisco's early rock days.\"  Bob Langmaid thinks these may have included Mountains of the Moon and Doin' That Rag, and probably St. Stephen.  According to Malcolm O'Brien, who attended the early show, the two opening country tunes were Green Grass and El Paso, with Garcia on pedal steel for both.  He also distinctly remember That's It For The Other One and thinks they may also have played New Potato Caboose.  David Galbraith, another audience member, confirms Green Grass, The Other One, and Morning Dew.","downloadSources":[],"recordings":"","contributors":["Jim Powell  Bob Langmaid  Malcolm O'Brien  David Galbraith"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"title":"[1:44:23]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:45","title":"The Story Of A Brick","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:11]","transition":";"},{"duration":"4:08","title":"Dupree's Diamond Blues","transition":">"},{"duration":"3:13","title":"Dire Wolf","transition":";"},{"title":"[2:01]","transition":";"},{"duration":"4:04","title":"Hard To Handle","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:54]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:19","title":"Silver Threads And Golden Needles","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:57]","transition":";"},{"duration":"6:06","title":"Casey Jones","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:07]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:25","title":"Sittin On Top Of The World","transition":">"},{"duration":"5:25","title":"Big Boss Man","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:27]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:50","title":"Mama Tried","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:16]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:20#","title":"High Time","transition":"%"},{"duration":"0:05","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"3:36","title":"Alligator","transition":">"},{"duration":"5:46","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"0:30","title":"drummers' chant","transition":">"},{"duration":"0:10","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"7:42","title":"Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"1:10","title":"And We Bid You Good Night Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"5:50","title":"Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"8:21","title":"The Other One","transition":">"},{"duration":"11:19","title":"Death Don't Have No Mercy","transition":">"},{"duration":"9:00#","title":"Turn On Your Love Light"}]}],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"NY State Pavilion, Flushing Meadow Park, Queens","city":"New York","state":"NY","date":"1969-07-11T07:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1960s/19690711.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"The soundboard cassette tape in circulation is rather degraded.  It breaks off during High Time at the end of Side A; Side B cuts in during the Drums after Alligator and breaks off during Turn On Your Love Light.  The audience tape in circulation runs from Alligator into The Other One before breaking off.  Some copies of the AUD run 30:46, breaking off 5:49 into The Other One ; others break off 0:52 earlier.  Probably more of this show exists on the AUD master, but only this portion seems to circulate.  Timings given here represent a composite of the SBD and AUD.At the beginning of this show Jerry says \"Testing.  Testing.  Testing.  People of New York!\" -- Phil interjects \"We space niggers greet you\" and then Jerry continues:  \"Now folks we understand from the management of this little establishment that if you want to, you can dance.  And I'll tell you where we're at behind it, it's really nice to play when people are dancing.\"  Garcia plays pedal steel guitar on Hard To Handle and Silver Threads.  At the end of Mama Tried they try to go directly into High Time and then break off -- \"Gotta tune up:  the weather is awful for tuning\" says Jerry.  The drummers chant is barely audible on the SBD and inaudible on the AUD (there were no vocals mics for the drummers ; it must be the drum mics picking it up on the SBD).  The Jam between Alligator and The Other One includes references to The Other One and to Caution, but is very much its own animal.\r\nAccording to a 7/27/69 article at http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/news/grateful-69.php they played Cosmic Charlie as an encore.Eaton lists:07/11/69 New York State Pavilion, Flushing Meadows Ny - complete  4.4, 089min, Sbd, A0D1, Cass M->Dat  1, 44k,  Ampex C-90 Master Cass/no dolby->3700 x 0->3800 x 1","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1969-07-11.123417.sbd.latvala.lee.smith.flac24 "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1969-07-11.123418.sbd.latvala-lee-smith.flac16 "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd69-07-11.sbd.hanno.4644.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"90 SB  35 A?Master recording source(s): Ampex C-90 Master Cass/no dolby","contributors":["Jim Powell  Marc Evans  Tim Anderson  Rob Eaton"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"title":"[1:44:23]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:36","title":"Green Green Grass Of Home","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:02]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:10","title":"Slewfoot","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:33]","transition":"%"},{"duration":"8:57","title":"Mountains Of The Moon","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:15]","transition":";"},{"duration":"7:58","title":"Doin' That Rag","transition":">"},{"duration":"6:12","title":"China Cat Sunflower","transition":">"},{"duration":"1:55","title":"Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"2:43","title":"Mama Tried","transition":">"},{"duration":"5:18#","title":"High Time","transition":"%"},{"duration":"#9:52","title":"Dark Star","transition":">"},{"duration":"5:36","title":"The Other One","transition":">"},{"duration":"6:03","title":"St. Stephen","transition":">"},{"duration":"15:05","title":"The Eleven","transition":">"},{"duration":"25:#13","title":"Turn On Your Love Light","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:25]"}]}],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"NY State Pavilion, Flushing Meadow Park, Queens","city":"New York","state":"NY","date":"1969-07-12T07:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1960s/19690712.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"The circulating tape of Green Grass, Slewfoot and Mountains is from an audience master.

The snippet of Good Lovin' which follows this on some copies of this side does not belong to this date.   On the other side of this cassette are six tunes from a Jefferson Airplane set from this date (Somebody To Love, Young Girl Sunday Blues, Wooden Ships, Volunteers, Saturday Afternoon, Uncle Sam's Blues).On the old cassette Dark Star is preceded by a count off and a 1-note false start from Phil, followed by a second count off.  This is clipped on the newly circulating copy.According to DeadBase IX before Dark Star they played Good Lovin' ; Me & My Uncle ; China Cat Sunflower > I Know You Rider ; Casey Jones ; High Time.  Reportedly it is not presently in the vault (12/99).  Eaton lists a 28 minute SBD reel excerpt from this date, perhaps containing these tunes.Jefferson Airplane and Sons of Champlin were also on the bill.  Sons of Champlin probably opened.

On the circulating tape the second part of Caution breaks off at 16:22, as Pigpen is winding it down.  This could be an hour-long reel running out.  There must be from 40 seconds to 2 minutes or more of transitional Jamming missing here.  When the recording resumes after this splice the band is playing a Jam in 4s.  After 12 seconds of this someone recites:When ya goin truckin down the line,just past that neighbor,you're fine,give him that bright eye,a saaaaad smile, and know that we've all been walkinthis same long mile.The voice is not a bandmember's.  Hunter and Kesey have been suggested but it sounds like neither.  The recitation is mildly mannered, and slightly suggestive of Dylan's phrasing in Clothesline Saga and other Basement Tapes.  Following these verses the Dead almost immediately dissolve the Jam and transit into the Main Ten.  The Jam in 4s shares thematic elements with the Main Ten.  Perhaps these verses are a first attempt at finding words to go with the Main Ten.  On the other hand, the recitation sounds improvised.

It was planned for Golden Gate Park, and the agreement was that the concert would be announced just a few days beforehand, to keep the park and city from being over-impacted.  When Mick Jagger announced the concert early to the press, San Francisco Parks & Recreation backed out.  As of 12/4 (as another announcement after Black Peter makes clear) concert planners thought they would be staging the show at Sears Point Raceway, but over the next 24 hours the site would be shifted a third and final time, to Altamont Speedway.Eaton lists:12/04/69 The Fillmore West, San Francisco Ca - complete  4.2, 115min, Sbd, A0D1, Cass M->Dat  1, 44k,  Ampex C-90 Master Cass/no dolby->3700 x 0->3800 x 1","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd69-12-04.sbd.cotsman.9496.sbeok.shnf "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd69-12-04.sbd.wizard.23975.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"115 SBMaster recording source(s): Ampex C-90 Master Cass/no dolby","contributors":["Jim Powell"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"title":"[1:47:41]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:16","title":"Me And My Uncle","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:55]","transition":"%"},{"duration":"4:#22","title":"Casey Jones","transition":"%"},{"duration":"9:10","title":"Black Peter","transition":"%"},{"duration":"2:20","title":"Mama Tried","transition":"%"},{"duration":"#5:16","title":"It Hurts Me Too","transition":"%"},{"duration":"6:51","title":"Cumberland Blues","transition":"%"},{"duration":"2:02","title":"Cryptical Envelopment","transition":">"},{"duration":"4:#45","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"title":"The Other One 8:#23]","transition":">"},{"duration":"1:30","title":"Eleven Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"2:37","title":"The Other One","transition":">"},{"duration":"2:13","title":"Cryptical Envelopment","transition":">"},{"duration":"5:#53","title":"Cosmic Charlie","transition":"%"},{"duration":"8:34","title":"Dancing In The Street","transition":"%"},{"duration":"4:40","title":"Dire Wolf","transition":"%"},{"duration":"#3:01","title":"China Cat Sunflower","transition":">"},{"duration":"5:00","title":"Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"4:03","title":"I Know You Rider","transition":">"},{"duration":"7:04","title":"High Time","transition":"%"},{"duration":"#0:39#","title":"Uncle John's Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"#2:43","title":"The Main Ten","transition":">"},{"duration":"11:14","title":"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"}]}],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Fillmore West","city":"San Francisco","state":"CA","date":"1969-12-05T08:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1960s/19691205.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"During the pause after Me & My Uncle, referring to the free concert the next day at Altamont Bobby says \"Bear wants me to tell you to bring dope\" and Jerry adds \"Not only that but it's something to do.\"Harry Ely mastered this AUD tape.

Given this taper's fast pause button finger, he's quite capable of having clipped the transition from Uncle John's Jam into the Main Ten, but unless he ran into serious trouble it's difficult to figure how he lost nearly the whole of Uncle John in a flip (he had a flip coming, probably, after Dire Wolf).

The sequence listed in SET 2 is probably not from the same set as the material listed in SET 1, though it is possible.  Which set came first is even more obscure.*Tapes of 12/11/69 & 12/12/69 have been in circulation for at least 25 years.  Often they used to be mislabeled \"Kaleidoscope Theater, LA,\" but the Thelma Theater venue was established as the correct labeling more than a dozen years ago and probably there are few tapes left now labeled with the wrong venue.  Parts of 12/11/69 still circulate mislabeled \"12/10/69,\" though, and other misdatings among the three shows also occur.*There is a 45-minute cassette side in circulation for at least 20 years often labeled \"Thelma Theater 12/10/69\" but sometimes also \"Thelma Theater 12/11/69,\" usually circulated in connection with other tapes from this run.  It begins with a copy of the 12/11/69 Dark Star which cuts immediately after \"transitive nightfall of diamonds\" and splices into the tape of That's It For The Other One > Cosmic Charlie listed in SET 2.  This turns out _not_ to be the 12/11/69 sequence, as previously assumed.  T.C.'s keys make it '69, the long Drums date it to September or after, the expansive Jamming points to the end of the year, and the micing sounds like the other Thelma Theater tapes, so we might as well call it 12/10/69 since that is far the most plausible date under which it circulates.  On this tape, Cosmic Charlie breaks off after 23 seconds.  There is a strong Cosmic Charlie tease at 2:19 into the Cryptical reprise.Curiously, a substantial fragment of this That's It > Cosmic Charlie forms part of another of the oldest bogus tapes in circulation.  This tape has been around since the mid-70s at least, and goes by many names, including \"Haight St. 3/3/68 II\", \"Winterland 4/3/68\" and \"San Francisco 6/8/68.\"  This 90-minute cassette consists of an unknown venue 1970 Good Lovin', followed by the San Diego 1/10/70 China Cat > Rider, Cold Rain and Hard To Handle, followed by the Avalon 4/6/69 That's It For The Other One > Death Don't.  Death Don't breaks off incomplete, splicing to the last 3:06 of the Drums of this tape of That's It > Cosmic Charlie (the same master) and cutting off after 51 seconds of Cosmic Charlie.

The old 90-minute cassette is boomy in the bass and somewhat over-modulated.

The old cassette version has Black Peter and the Good Lovin' Drums intact, but it cuts at 1:26 into the Jam out of China Cat and resumes after a splice close to the beginning of High Time ; the Rider is entirely missing ; and the Turn On Your Love Light also has a cut at around 10 minutes with a couple minutes lost.  The timings given above are based on a composite of the two tapes.The performance of Turn On Your Love Light breaks off at 23:15, as Pigpen is starting to wind things up, when power to the stage is cut and all the instruments go dead (but not the vocals mic) -- \"they've pulled the plug on us\" -- less than 5 minutes short of where Pig would have concluded anyways.

The circulating soundboard cuts just as The Other One's last vocals are ending, and resumes immediately afterward near the beginning of Cosmic Charlie.  Though it's missing on the tape, it seems almost certain that they went on to play the Cryptical reprise before transitting into Cosmic Charlie.  Since this reprise varies from 2 minutes to 12 or more, it's difficult to say how much music is missing here.  Dark Star cuts as they are gliding down toward the second vocals ; probably around 3-4 minutes are missing before the end of the tune.  After this cut the tape splices to the tag end of Alligator.  It is usually assumed that the set ran Dark Star > Alligator, but this is a short set as the circulating tape runs, even after adding 3 minutes of Dark Star and 4 of Alligator, and it seems possible that more than that is missing here.There is a tape flip at 1:40 into the following Drums, but little is lost here.
