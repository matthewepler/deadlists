Transcribed by Teddy GoodBear:  Up at the Fillmore Auditorium, Ken Kesey's Acid test event was in action  when I got there around the middle of the evening. The people were like  the backstage crowd at the California Hall dance (that the Airplane played  the same night). The costumes were, wow! a strobe light was flickering at  a very high frequency in one corner of the hall and a group of people were  bouncing a golden balloon up and down in it. It was a most perturbing  frequency.  in one corner there was a piece of metal, tubular sculpture by Ron Boise,  a thumping machine. If you hit it, you got different sounds if you hit it  in different places. There was a lot of electronic equipment which sent  out a low reverberation that resonated throughout the hall. and the whole  place was filled with streamers and balloons. There were tV cameras and a  tV screen, and you could see yourself in it. Onstage there was a rock  group; anybody could play with them. It was a kind of social Jam session.  a guy in a white mechanic's suit with a black cross on the front, and on  the back a sign saying 'Please Don't Believe in Magic', ran up and down  all night. Oh wow! Periodically the lights went out and everybody cheered.  Giant Frisbees, balloons like basketballs, acrobats, girls in felt  eyelashes four inches long, people with eyes painted on their foreheads,  glasses low on the nose with eyes painted on them, men with foxes on their  shoulders!

Kesey and I and [fellow Merry Prankster] George [Foster] went in there and  started laying this stuff down. The Grateful Dead had been playing the  Haight down at the Straight theater. They came down and showed up.  The real tragedy of all this is we must have been in there all night long,  like six or eight hours. Jim the Host was responsible for editing down and  mixing the session. But he took all the master tape and he made the tape  that went into the record.

Circulates as 02/12/66, but is  unknown. Also see 03/??/66. What is most famous about the Watts test, is  the \"Who Cares\" woman.  Jeff Tiedrich:  David Gans edited 'Pigpen's Rap' and 'Schoolgirl>You Don't Love  Me>Schoolgirl' together on GDH #388 (thus no splice) for the purposes of  his broadcast. It should be noted that the date and location of the  'Pigpen Rap' is pure speculation. Dick Latvala informs us that the box and  7\" reel from which this was taken is completely unlabelled.  Transcription:  the 'rap' starts with chattering and screaming in the background and Jerry  (?) saying into the mike \"Nobody Cares\".  You can hear Bobby and then  Pigpen tells his 'story'.  When Pig is done Bobby says \"Someday Ron will take acid.\"   Owsley \"Bear\" Stanley:  the \"Pigpen rap\" that Gans took from an unlabeled box, with an intro from  Jer \"Nobody Cares\" would have been an excerpt of a tape from the Watts  Acid test, or a show immediately after that gig. It is most likely,  especially if there is a bunch of static on one channel (left I think),  that it came from that test. The test, the third in LA, was in early March  1966.  Owsley later goes on to say:  this is absolutely the Watts Acid test. There was a woman who Babbs was  putting the mic onto who kept screaming \"Who cares?\" over and over at  least a hundred times. I also think I recall the comment by Bobby on Pig's  non acid-taking. There was a great Pig rap at that test, I would guess the  tape was from the Prankster's tape machine.  Transcribed by Teddy GoodBear from 'The taping Compendium':  According to Vault archivist Dick Latvala, the material here comes from  two different seven-inch reel boxes, the Pigpen rap in an unlabeled one,  the other marked \"Longshoreman's #1,\" with no other information. The  intriguing thing is that both tapes have identical ambiences, and Bobby's  comment has the same ambience and feel as the segment with Pigpen's rap.","downloadSources":[],"recordings":"(?) FM.

David Sorochty:  the full tape is kind of a loop, with the same exact version of 'Sick and  tired' on it twice.  The second time it fades out. I believe that 'It's a  Sin' and 'Sick and tired' which also circulate separately are incorrectly  identified as \"1/7/66\".  The fact that DeadBase has a list for \"1/7/66\" which includes It's a Sin  and Sick and tired (in that order) is probably the reason for all the confusion in the first place.  The \"1/7/66\" list has been in there since the first edition or two, but I don't know where they got it from.  Teddy GoodBear & David Sorochty: SET1: Standing on the Corner [3:32] ; Mindbender [2:51] ; it Hurts Me too  [3:44] ; Viola Lee Blues [7:24] ; I Know You Rider [2:41] ; It's a Sin [2:55] ; Sick and tired Sick and tired [3:29]   We suspect due to the set list similarity that this might really be from the show that DeadBase X calls \"5/19/66\", a show that was not listed in any of their previous editions.  See \"5/19/66\" for further explanation.  DeadBase X also has \"2/23/66\" with this setlist as well as, (previous editions prior to DeadBase X), list it under \"11/29/66\".  Early Morning Rain and Cold Rain that circulate (as listed in DeadBase X)  for this date are filler that do go with \"11/29/66\". See \"11/29/66\" for  further explanation.

However this is not exactly a partial copy of  3/12/66. The versions of You See a Broken Heart and Midnight Hour# are the  same as on the complete 3/12/66, but the Viola Lee Blues is definitely a  different version. So hold onto those older tapes.

We did  everything ourselves, all in two days. We plastered handbills all over  Hollywood. Stage decor was a few lengths of paisley cloth purchased that  afternoon at a fabric store. For a box office, we had a card table and a  cigar box.  Our not-quite-full house must have had over a hundred people; and when the  night was over, our net take was $75. At 2 o'clock in the morning, we went  to Cantor's Deli on Fairfax and spent it all on dinner for everybody --  with desert. -- Grateful Dead Family Album (page 43).  http://www.pompano.net/~goodbear/concert_art/03_25_66-1.html  http://www.pompano.net/~goodbear/concert_art/03_25_66-2.html   to listen to the show using \"Real Audio\":  http://sugarmegs.org/ram/gd3-25-66.ram  http://www.deadlegs.com/tunes/1960/1966/32566/32566.ram","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd66-03-25.sbd.unknown.38.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"30 SB.

The Grateful Dead were each paid twenty-five dollars a week in  those days and gigged wherever they could, often five days a week. An  incredible freedom cruised through each day like a tide. The Jefferson  Airplane, It's a Beautiful Day, Country Joe & the Fish, the Sons of  Champlin, Quicksilver Messenger Service, the Charlatans, Big Brother & the  Holding Company...  Weekend free-form celebrations of whatever anyone wished to celebrate,  beginning in party clothes at the main house, ending naked in the sunshine  by the pool. In addition to the Harley-scaled acreage, a huge outdoor oven  cranked non-stop. It was the Diggers baking their daily bread to give away  later in the park. As each participant got coated with flour, ghostly  apparitions would leap from the oven to the pool, long hair flying in the  wind. It was an easy scene for music and lovers, bands interwove and  produced moments that were as high as they get. -- Grateful Dead Family  Album (page 33).  Transcribed by Teddy GoodBear:  the Dead used to have some pretty good parties out at their place in the  country, in Olompali. Two or three hundred people would come, and of  course, most of them probably took LSD. This was around the time that a  lot of new ground was being broken socially, and it seemed like a third to  half the people at these parties would be naked, hanging around the pool.  it was a great place. It was sort of a ranch estate that had a nice big  house that looked kind of like tara in 'Gone With the Wind'. Then there  was a lot of land around it -- hills, a creek in the back, a big lawn and  the pool. It was maybe 1000 feet off the highway, so it was fairly  secluded.  in between the house and the pool the Dead would set up their equipment  and play from time to time during the day. Usually there'd be members of  other bands there too, like the Airplane and Quicksilver, and there'd be  little jams with people who wanted to play. I remember that the Dead would  be playing and Neal Cassady would be doing this strange little dance -- it  was almost like breakdancing; very fluid. Out on the lawn there was this  very far-out configuration of plumbing that was once part of a sprinkler  system or something. It stuck out of the ground and stood maybe five feet  high. I could'nt. figure out what the hell it was for. It was just a mess  of pipes with faucets coming out of it that had been modified over the  years. Very strange. So the Dead would be playing, and Neal would be  dancing on the lawn with this bizarre metal partner. He'd dance around it,  with it really. He had some pretty good moves, too. Neal was always in the  thick of things.  Those parties -- I'm not sure how many of them there were -- were always  on a nice afternoon. Everyone would play all day in the sunshine -- just  doing everything -- and then when the sun would start to go down and it  got cold, people would pack it in. By the time it was dark most people  were gone, but there were always enough people who were either around to  begin with or who wanted to stay, so that the party would continue inside.  in fact, with the number of people hanging out there all the time, it was  pretty much a party all the time anyway. I don't. know if it was 24 hours  a day, but every time I was there it was going. -- George Hunter (The  Golden Road).

Millionaire (vocals) (see the ??/??/66 listing for more  information on those) as well as these obvious filler songs;  1969 studio - I'm a Lovin Man (Pigpen and Weir vocals, Garcia pedal steel  & John tenney on fiddle)  Instrumental (Bucky's tune)   An edited version of this circulates as \"2/5/66 Questing Beast Rehearsal\".  Based on the list provided by Steve McHenry we can see that the  differences are that the Questing Beast tape does not include:  a) takes 7 and 8# of Don't Ease Me in (both are instrumental versions)  b) Cardboard Cowboy (takes 1 through 4 without vocals)  c) Stealin' take 1 (instrumental)  d) Cold Rain and Snow# (the very last one)  e) the additional material that was identified as possibly being from the  Scorpio recording sessions (Lindy, and Alice D. Millionaire)  f) the obvious filler material which was identified as being from 1969 -  (I'm a Lovin Man and the instrumental referred to as Bucky's tune)   Steve's notes indicate that his Questing Beast tape has a brief You Don't  Have to Ask which I have not noted on my full Scorpio tape. It is probably  on the Scorpio tape and I just missed it. Steve has also reported that his  tape does not have the take number spoken before each rendition as on the  Scorpio tape. With the take numbers edited out and the filler removed in  order to squeeze this all onto one tape, it might give the impression that  this is a practice session.

July 1966 release, but the actual date of  the recording is more than likely sometime in June. See the above info  listed under 6/??/66 and 2/5/66.  From 'Taping Compendium':  Gene Estribou had the first four-track in the San Francisco area, Buena  Vista Studio, and here the Dead cut their first demo in June 1966. He was  introduced to the Dead by photographer Herb Greene, when the band was  playing in Palo Alto and Garcia still played bluegrass.  Gene Estribou:  First we had an Ampex three-channel instrumentation deck that Henry Jacobs  brought into the studio. I had built a big horn and a studio and we had  good condenser mikes and spent a lot of time optimizing the board. We went  down to Western Recording and used their studio for doing some tapes that  ended up being on the first 45 from Scorpio...  See these 45's produced under the \"Scorpio\" labels:  http://www.pompano.net/~goodbear/concert_art/stealin.jpg  http://www.pompano.net/~goodbear/concert_art/dontez.jpg   Michael Wanger:  Teddy,   thanks for your inquiry. Here's a bit of history:   I met Bob Weir while attending Menlo School for Boys in 1961. Through Bob,  I met his good friend, Vance Frost. Bob and I pursued our mutual interest  in folk music and eventually performed together in a band called \"The  Uncalled Four.\" During the summer of 1964, while Vance and I were  traveling around the country living out of a '56 Chevy station wagon, my  brother, Peter Wanger, made a recording of Mother McCree's Uptown Jug  Champions at top of the tangent in Palo Alto.  Many years later, while attending Stanford University, I had a radio  program for which I produced a series of documentaries on various aspects  of the sixties' folk and rock and roll scene. After several programs, I  asked my friend Vance to accompany me on air in order to provide a little  more liveliness to the program. This approach was so successful that we  decided to take it to the next step. We approached KSAN's Program  Director, tom Donahue, with the idea of producing similar documentaries  for KSAN. We wanted to start with Grateful Dead because we knew some of  the band members and had the McCree recording.  Donahue gave us an official go-ahead, so in the late fall and early winter  of 1968 we began our interviews. We met with the entire band at Alembic,  the band's Marin \"clubhouse\" as they called it, and recorded everyone but  Pigpen who declined to be interviewed. We got such great stuff that we  charged ahead with interviews of John Cipollina and David Freiberg of  Quicksilver Messenger Service, Paul Kantner and Spencer Dryden of  Jefferson Airplane and Ralph J. Gleason, the jazz critic for the S. F.  Chronicle who was a strong advocate for the new music that was coming out  of San Francisco.  Starting in early 1969, we began putting the pieces together using the  equipment at Golden State Recorders where Vance worked as an engineer. To  fill out the early part of Grateful Dead's music history, we requested  some early recordings. Rock Sculley gave us the first two singles,  \"Stealin'\" and \"Don't Ease Me In,\" along with some Fillmore recordings  from 1966. We made copies and returned the originals to the Dead. The tape  box labels featured on page 104 of the \"The Deadhead's taping Compendium\"  is our label for those tapes. The documentary aired on KSAN in June, 1969.  I guess there was an assumption, based on those box labels, that Vance and  I had made some early recordings of Grateful Dead. Well, sad to say, it  never happened.  Currently, I am working with Grateful Dead Productions on an Enhanced CD  of the McCree recording. The multimedia portion will contain a 1964  interview with Jerry, Bob and other band members. I also expect to include  the first 11 minutes of the documentary which traces Grateful Dead's  history up through their jug band period.  Well, Teddy, it's been fun dredging up all these memories. Please let me  know if you have any questions.  Best,   Michael Wanger  11/24/98","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd66-07-01.sbd.vernon.19924.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"10 SB, from tape (not vinyl) source. 10 (45 RPM) LP.

To listen to the show using \"Real Audio\":  http://sugarmegs.org/ram/gd7-3-66.ram   David Sorochty:  Most tapes have the song order listed in Deadbase 9 and earlier editions,  which is incorrect. The correct song order is what's listed above. Our  tapes seem to come from two shorter tapes which overlap a bit at the  beginning of Viola Lee Blues.  Here's what's on my DAT tape which comes from a low gen reel:  7/3/66 Part 1 - some of the between song talking, then:  Viola Lee Blues  Big Boss Man  Sittin' on top of the World#  Filler (Scorpio 45 RPM):  Don't Ease Me in  Stealin'  7/3/66 Part 2:  Dancin' in the Streets  I Know You Rider#  #He Was a Friend of Mine  Next time You See Me  all of the between song talking intact with no splice and then:  Viola Lee Blues# (cuts out after just a minute or so)   it is apparent that chronologically what I call Part 2 comes first, then  Part 1 - they just overlap a bit on the beginning of Viola Lee. Most  cassette tapes in circulation have the above order with the Scorpio filler  moved to the end (sometimes the Viola Lee overlap part is intact, other  times it is cut off). A few tapes in circulation have Part 2 first and  then Part 1 with the overlap removed (which I believe is the right order)  and the Scorpio filler last.  DeadBase X does list what I believe is the correct song order and also  lists several more songs which do not circulate. They are: Unknown,  Minglewood, Cold Rain, Unknown, BIODTL, Cream Puff War & It's a Good  thing.\"   Dick Latvala - According to DeadLists Digests #534:  ftp://gdead.berkeley.edu/pub/gdead/set-lists/DEADLIST_PROJECT/digest-archive/v01.n534  Dick Latvala has crossed out \"it's a good thing\" and written \"MESS UP a  GOOD tHING CARDBOARD COWBOY\". Is this the real name of the song we call  \"Cardboard Cowboy\"? Or did Dick forget to put a comma after 'Mess Up a  Good thing' and the next song would be 'Carboard Cowboy'?  thayer Jennings: \"My reasoning for listing He Was a Friend of Mine and  Next time before Viola Lee:* I have three different copies of this -- two  of the three are similar to the DeadBase listing (i.e. with Friend of Mine  and Next time at the end of the set)... but the last copy came to me  mislabeled as \"04/23/66 San Fran\"... but it is actually this (07/03/66).  The set list on this third copy is the same as I've listed above (cutting  in on Friend of Mine and cutting out during top of the World). The key  'dead air' segment -- between Next time and Viola Lee is intact.  There is a small bit of conversation between the two (which partially  exists on my other copies):   Next time > applause > Garcia [to band]: \"Had to do it man. I had to do  it.\" (laughter) \"I just had to do it, you know how it is.\" (pause, but no  splice)   Pigpen [to Garcia (or band)]: \"Viola Lee Blues\". Garcia [to audience]: \"We  had a request for this... before... before we did it. and uh...\"   Lesh(?) [in background, to band]: \"I don't know, man. I can't tell by  this...(?)\"   Garcia [continuing, to audience]: \"...and... it's called Viola Lee Blues.\"   Weir(?): \"Aww, no...\"> Viola Lee Blues.\"   DeadBase X [under 'mislabelled tapes']:  Many copies of this have four additional songs after Next time You See Me.  Stealin' and Don't. Ease are from the Scorpio Records single. Lindy is  from 'Historic Dead' and Baby Blue is from 'Vintage Dead'. This tape is  sometimes dated 9/4/66.  DeadBase X [under 'Tape timings']:  there is a silver of Don't. Ease introduction that cuts almost immediately  between top of the World and Dancin'.

It's called Viola  Lee Blues.\" Bobby: \"Oooh Nooo!\"   Before I Know You Rider -- Jerry:  \"Along with our previous dedication dedicating this evening's sets on our  part to the Sundancers in Ignatio, Colorado, we'd also like to dedicate a  certain portion of this to Mnasidika, this little clothes store, you know,  down on Haight Street that has some things and it's all right, and it's  all right... indeed.

The Grateful Dead were each paid twenty-five dollars a week in  those days and gigged wherever they could, often five days a week. An  incredible freedom cruised through each day like a tide. The Jefferson  Airplane, It's a Beautiful Day, Country Joe & the Fish, the Sons of  Champlin, Quicksilver Messenger Service, the Charlatans, Big Brother & the  Holding Company...  Weekend free-form celebrations of whatever anyone wished to celebrate,  beginning in party clothes at the main house, ending naked in the sunshine  by the pool. In addition to the Harley-scaled acreage, a huge outdoor oven  cranked non-stop. It was the Diggers baking their daily bread to give away  later in the park. As each participant got coated with flour, ghostly  apparitions would leap from the oven to the pool, long hair flying in the  wind. It was an easy scene for music and lovers, bands interwove and  produced moments that were as high as they get. -- Grateful Dead Family  Album (page 33).  Transcribed by Teddy GoodBear:  the Dead used to have some pretty good parties out at their place in the  country, in Olompali. Two or three hundred people would come, and of  course, most of them probably took LSD. This was around the time that a  lot of new ground was being broken socially, and it seemed like a third to  half the people at these parties would be naked, hanging around the pool.  it was a great place. It was sort of a ranch estate that had a nice big  house that looked kind of like tara in 'Gone With the Wind'. Then there  was a lot of land around it -- hills, a creek in the back, a big lawn and  the pool. It was maybe 1000 feet off the highway, so it was fairly  secluded.  in between the house and the pool the Dead would set up their equipment  and play from time to time during the day. Usually there'd be members of  other bands there too, like the Airplane and Quicksilver, and there'd be  little jams with people who wanted to play. I remember that the Dead would  be playing and Neal Cassady would be doing this strange little dance -- it  was almost like breakdancing; very fluid. Out on the lawn there was this  very far-out configuration of plumbing that was once part of a sprinkler  system or something. It stuck out of the ground and stood maybe five feet  high. I could'nt. figure out what the hell it was for. It was just a mess  of pipes with faucets coming out of it that had been modified over the  years. Very strange. So the Dead would be playing, and Neal would be  dancing on the lawn with this bizarre metal partner. He'd dance around it,  with it really. He had some pretty good moves, too. Neal was always in the  thick of things.  Those parties -- I'm not sure how many of them there were -- were always  on a nice afternoon. Everyone would play all day in the sunshine -- just  doing everything -- and then when the sun would start to go down and it  got cold, people would pack it in. By the time it was dark most people  were gone, but there were always enough people who were either around to  begin with or who wanted to stay, so that the party would continue inside.  in fact, with the number of people hanging out there all the time, it was  pretty much a party all the time anyway. I don't. know if it was 24 hours  a day, but every time I was there it was going. -- George Hunter (The  Golden Road).

Interview, but no songs other than  commercially released material. According to Garcia's statements in the  interview, the interview took place sometime during the latter part of  1966. The transcription of the interview can be seen at:  http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Palms/2635/interview66.html   tom Ordon:  in early 1967, I taped an interview with the Grateful Dead that was being  re-broadcast on KFRC in San Francisco. It was originally broadcast on KFRC  in November, 1966. The disc jockey was Steve O'Shea and the program was  called \"KFRC Perspective\". The length of the interview is 22 minutes and  22 seconds long. No songs were played. I am certain that David Gans has  the whole thing because he stopped by my home in Dallas, texas, in the  late seventies, primarily to record it. He gave me credit in the back of  his book, \"Playing In The Band\", for supplying the tape.  David Sorochty:  it begins with a pre-recorded radio station item which is like a choir  singing the numbers of the year out like this:   Nineteeeeen Sixty-Siiiiiiiiiiix!   the interview begins and Jerry, Pigpen, Billy, and Bob are present. Phil  is not and they say he had an errand to run or something like that.  There is a mention that the band has been together for about a year now.  The interviewer says that he has seen them a few times at the Fillmore.  They mention that there are fans during the interview. There is talk of  Pigpen t-shirts being available and that the picture of him on the front  of the shirt may have been on a Family Dog concert poster. They give the  interviewer a complementary Pigpen t-shirt and he says he'll have to  figure out somewhere to wear it! the whole thing is 6 mins 47 secs long.  Right in the last second of the interview the song Good Morning Little  Schoolgirl is cross-faded in as the last words of the interview fade out.  Schoolgirl gets cut after 47 seconds. This version seemed unusually clean  and sounded a lot like a prerecorded studio recording. On a hunch, I cued  this up with my CD of the first album and discovered that this is actually  the version on the first album. I am positive it is a match. Since we know  for sure the interview was in 1966, and the first album wasn't recorded  till 1967, the Schoolgirl is something that was obviously tacked on later  by someone and is unrelated to the interview.","downloadSources":[],"recordings":"22 FM, Tom Ordon reel (7 1/2 ips mono).","contributors":["David Sorochty "," Tom Ordon  "," Teddy GoodBear "],"caretaker":{"name":"Teddy Goodbear","email":"teddy@goodbear.com"}},{"sets":[],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Avalon Ballroom","city":"San Francisco","state":"CA","date":"1966-11-03T07:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1960s/19661103.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"Other artist(s): Oxford Circle.

See that date for more information \r\nTo see Wes Wilson Concert Art:  http://www.pompano.net/~goodbear/concert_art/11_18-20_66.html  http://www.peconic.net/members/worwetz/aa7.htm   to listen to the show using \"Real Audio\":  http://sugarmegs.org/ram/dead66.ram   thayer Jennings:  Bill Graham introduces the band before Cold Rain and Snow -  (cut)\"...igpen, on organ and vocals; on the left, rhythm guitar and  vocals, Mister Bob Weir; on bass and vocals, Mister Philip Lesh; on drums,  in striped t-shirt, Mister Bill Summer; on the far left, on lead guitar  and vocals, the Charles Atlas of the psychedelic set; the Grateful Dead.\"   the reasoning for listing Cold Rain before Hi-Heel Sneakers -  * the tape is ordered this way -- there *is* a splice between Cold Rain  andHi-Heel Sneakers, but *not* between Pain I.M.H and BIODTL.  * Bill Graham's intro is before Cold Rain. Would the introduction have  come *after* a couple songs??? (I kind of doubt it).  DeadBase X [under 'Tape timings']:  After Pain in My Heart -- Pigpen:  \"Thank you.\"   Before BIODTL -- ?: \"It's Over.\" -- Jerry:  \"It seems like it's just begun. What can I say here after I say this? Good  evening. The number tonight... everybody check your coupons... The lucky  number tonight is ten.\" Phil: \"What? Hey, wait a minute, How many?\"   Jerry: How many? Eleven? Eleven. Pardon me.\" Phil: \"The magic number is  eleven.\" BIODTL -- 11 beats.  Short tuning ditty before He Was a Friend. Tape cuts into and out of Teddy  Bear's Picnic before Smokestack. After Midnight Hour -- Pigpen: \"Thank  You.\"   David Sorochty:  Filler on tape - unidentified You See a Broken Heart, is from 3/12/66.  The common tapes, including mine, have this order:  Hi-Heel Sneakers  Pain in My Heart  -----------------------splice------  Cold Rain and Snow  -----------------------splice------  Beat it on Down the Line  Cream Puff War  Same thing  He Was a Friend of Mine  (Dancin' in the Street is missing)  in fact I had always thought that was the right order. I never doubted it  and that is how its been listed in DeadBase too. Notice that there is a  splice right before and after Cold Rain and Snow and that intoduction is  missing. I'm willing to accept that my tape was out of order and it also  had the intro cut out. But something about that seemed strange because I  was absolutely positive that I had heard at least part of that \"Charles  Atlas\" introduction before. But how could that be possible? I've only ever  had one copy of 11/19/66 and its not on there.  Then I saw a post from Bart Wise where he said in regards to 2/12/67:  \"I checked out my copy of 2/12/67 last night. Mine also has the Smokestack  in between the other two songs and runs:   Bill Graham Intro -no audible cut-, Cold Rain and Snow % -cuts in-,  Smokestack Lightning -cuts out-, % -cuts in- Hi Heeled Sneakers.  Bill Graham's intro is chopped up and reads: '...and on the far left...and  on the lead guitar and vocals...the Charles Atlas of the psychedelic  set...the Grateful Dead.' and without an audible cut, Cold Rain and Snow.\"  there it was again, the \"Charles Atlas\" introduction right before Cold  Rain and Snow with no splice. That was exactly where I recalled hearing it  from - my 2/12/67 tape! it didn't seem likely that the same intro would be  used twice right before they start playing the same song. I wondered if  2/12/67 might be a bogus mislabeled partial copy of 11/19/66?   Even though I didn't have the intro on my 11/19/66 tape I compared the two  versions of just the song Cold Rain and Snow by cueing them up so they  were in perfect sync with each other and listening to them simultaneously.  I did this several times and found that they are note for note identical.  The real clincher was at the very end of the song in the last second or so  there is some yelling from the audience that is also on both tapes which  occurs just as it quiets down, but before the music finally stops. You can  just barely hear it, but two people yell out what sounds like \"Hey\" and  \"Yeah\" in quick succession. It sounds almost like one word \"HeyYeah\". Its  kind of hard to hear, but its there on both tapes. These are definitely  the same versions.  I then checked the two versions of Hi-Heeled Sneakers and there is some  reverb at the beginning of 2/12/67 which is not on 11/19/66 (this was  mentioned by Bart). The reverb dies down after a minute or less though for  the most part. Aside from that they do seem to be played the exact same  way on both tapes. In fact there is one time where Jerry sings the word  \"Sneakers\" and his voice kind of catches and cracks a little. That is  definitely on both tapes which is kind of odd in itself.  I checked the two versions of Smokestack and those seemed at first to be  close, but the 2/12/67 Smokestack runs slow compared to the one from  11/19/66. They do definitely come from the same time frame where they  played the song the same exact way. Even all of the ooo-oohs and  aaah-aaahs from Pigpen match up just right. The speed difference is  significant and again I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that they are the  very same rendition but they are at least very close time frame wise.  Smokestack gets cut off on 2/12/67 so you can't check for some strange  identifiable yells from the audience right at the end of the song.  The interesting thing is that 2/12/67 has been around for a long time and  11/19/66 just came out of hiding all of a sudden at the same time as  3/18/67 did back in 1989. (I checked the Smokestack on 3/18/67 and its not  the same as the one on 2/12/67 for sure).  The bottom line is that I'm convinced \"2/12/67\" is some sort of a  compilation tape. I'm convinced that the intro, Cold Rain and Snow and  Hi-Heeled Sneakers are definitely from 11/19/66. However the Smokestack  (which might actually be a studio recording) seems to be played *very*  similarly to the version on 11/19/66, but there may be some differences  and no clincher to really prove it is the same as the 11/19/66 version.  Maybe some other tape will show up from this time frame which will turn  out to be the real source for that song.

Early  Morning Rain and Cold Rain and Snow are before Viola Lee Blues in set 2 of  this show, not the \"2/23/66\" tape. Source for Cream Puff War as listed as  set 1 in DeadBase X unidentified (see 5/19/66). Some cassettes in  circulation do have the songs as listed in Deadbase X.  David Sorochty & Teddy GoodBear recap of DeadBase X:  DeadBase X and our notations in parenthesis -  Set 1: Cream Puff War. (see 5/19/66)  Set 2: Same as DeadLists Set 2 (see above 11/29/66), except DeadBase X do  not list 'Early Morning' & 'Cold Rain'. They list it on 2/23/66.  Set 3: Same as DeadLists Set 3 (see above 11/29/66).  DeadBase Footnote: this is probably from more than one show, dates  unknown.  (1) \"Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\" tuning after 'I Just Want'.  DeadBase X [under 'mislabelled tapes']:  tapes with this date are a mixture of at least two shows which may  actually all be from The Matrix. The time frame of this material seems to  span from January to December of 1966. Sometimes this tape shows up dated  2/23/66. We have this date listed as \"location unknown\" but whether the  Dead actually played that night remains a mystery.  David Sorochty:  Here is *some* of the in-between talking that should clarify the sets and  the reason why I'm sure that Early Morning Rain and Cold Rain and Snow  really do go where we say they do -   Side a - SET 2:   Jerry: \"I'd like to start off the second set with a Cowboy song.\"  ?: \"Cowboy song.\"  Jerry: \"Cowboy song.\"   Me and My Uncle, Same thing.  Jerry: \"an old jug band song - it's called Stealin'\"  Jerry: \"just Stealin'\"   Stealin'   Jerry: \"thank you\"  ?: \"Ha, ha, ha\"  Jerry: \"gonna do a rock and roll song\"  Jerry: \"famous old rock and roll song\"  Bobby: \"for all you old geezers\"   Big Boy Pete   Jerry: \"thank you\"  Jerry: \"So much for our lights\"   one Kind Favor   ?: \"Jerry\"  Bobby: \"We already did that one.\"  Jerry: \"We're changing our name to comedy relief.\"  ?: \"comic relief\"  Jerry: \"We're changing your name to... uh comic relief\"  ?: \"Cold Rain and Snow\"  Jerry: \"No, no - Early Morning Rain first\"  ?: \"ha, ha, ha\"  Jerry: \"I can't do it - I'm sick\"  Jerry: \"Early Morning Rain? Early Morning Rain?\"  Pigpen: \"Get outta here\"  Jerry: \"Who's that out there?\"  various: \"Marty, Marty, hey Marty, Marty, Marty\"  Jerry: \"Yeah, with a half step then\"  Phil: \"We're telling all our secrets\"   Early Morning Rain   Jerry: \"Doesn't sound at all like you remembered it - does it Marty?\"  Jerry: \"thank you kindly\"  Phil: \"Nurse - could we have another Coca Cola up here please?\"  Jerry: \"I could have done it too\"   Cold Rain and Snow   ?: \"Have another Coke.\"  ?: \"...next\"  Jerry: \"Viola Lee Blues\"  ?: \"yeah\"   Side B:   Jerry: \"What are you having to drink Phil?\"  Phil: \"Just plain Coke, plain old Coke\"  Jerry: \"Plain old, good old, happy old Coca Cola.\"  Bobby?: \"If you will.\"  Pigpen: \"Ever feel like you needed windshield wipers on your contact  lenses?\"  Jerry: \"Can't make it work - how do you make it work?\"  Jerry: \"Ouch!\"  ?: \"Want a chair to stand on Jerry?\"  ?: \"All right what is it?\"  ?: \"Hey that's pretty good\"  Jerry: \"I like that\"  Jerry: \"The name of this song is - uh - Viola - Lee - Blues   Viola Lee Blues   ?: \"thank you\"  Jerry: \"That's the end of the second set, we'll be back a little later  with the third set; the third and final set. In other words that set was  the second to the final set.\"   Set 3:  Down So Long  Jerry: \"thank you\"  Something on Your Mind  ?: \"thank you\"  Lindy, Good Morning Little Schoolgirl  Pigpen: \"thank you\"  I Just Want to Make Love to You  Jerry: \"Well it's about that time again\"  Merry-Go-Round tuning  Pigpen: \"Bye - we all knew that part\"  Jerry: \"In spite of it all....\"   I have no doubt that this is all one show. In fact there really isn't any  reason to think that it's not. It's just that we only have (mid 1998)  tapes of sets 2 and 3 (and they really are sets 2 and 3). Maybe set 1 was  never recorded or its just that it doesn't circulate if it does exist.  I also know why DeadBase does their lists the way they do:   First as I described above I think they have one of the 2/23/66 tapes with  the Early Morning Rain and Cold Rain and Snow from 11/29/66 added on as  filler. Second there are some tapes of 11/29/66 Sets 2 and 3 that are  missing Early Morning Rain and Cold Rain and Snow on side a and have  #Viola Lee at the end of side a instead (without the in between talking)  and then just set 3 on side :B.  That version is missing the talking before Viola Lee that is key to  understanding that those other two songs fit in where they do and this  really is all one show.  Without the continuing talk about requesting Coca Colas before and after  Cold Rain and Snow and also before the complete Viola Lee Blues you  wouldn't know that. That is what they must have and that is why their  lists are like that. I have the better more complete version of 11/29/66  Sets 2 and 3. I also had one of the other versions. I have never had a  copy with Cream Puff War that cuts at the beginning of side a on my  11/29/66. I do kind of wonder where it really goes, that is the only thing  in doubt.  it is possible that it is only on some 2/23/66 tapes but I'm not sure of  that. Maybe the DeadBase folks saw a set 2 and 3 from one show and this  other set that looked kind of like a set 1 and they combined them in their  books for a while. I think that is the source of all the confusion. The  doubt about 11/29/66 being from a single show is just in their minds  because they don't have the most complete copy where you can figure this  out.","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1966-11-29.sbd.graham-perlstein.106497.flac16 "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1966-11-29.sbd.thecore.4940.shnf "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd66-11-29.sbd.ret.20448.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"74 SB.

Matt Schofield:  Evidence that there was at least a planned show for this night.

But that's maybe something that will have to  wait until all those newspaper articles are online.  This from the SF Chronicle of 12.1.66. Small article on page 46. With a  picture of Garcia and Pigpen. (one word is illegible on the photocopy that  I have - but it really does say 'Pen is the lead singer').  \"From a Jug\"   \"Jerry Garcia, left, and Pig Pen are a [?] two fifth of the Grateful Dead,  the blues-rock group which will play a dance concert at 9 tomorrow night  at Pauley Ballroom, University of California. Garcia is the lead  guitarist, Pen is lead singer and plays harmonica and organ. The group,  which has been in existence for about 16 months, is one of the two most  popular organizations in the Bay Area.  it evolved out of a jug band which included Garcia, Pen and Bob Weir, the  Dead's rhythm guitarist. Phil Lesh is the bassist, Bill Sommers is the  drummer.\"","downloadSources":[],"recordings":"","contributors":["Matt Schofield "," DeadBase X"],"caretaker":{"name":"Teddy Goodbear","email":"teddy@goodbear.com"}},{"sets":[],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Fillmore Auditorium","city":"San Francisco","state":"CA","date":"1966-12-09T08:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1960s/19661209.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"Other artist(s): Big Mama Mae thornton & tim Rose.
