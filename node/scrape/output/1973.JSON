Sound mixing problems at the board during Promised Land. According to reports from an eyewitness, this was the result of half the speakers frying.Very brief splice during Looks Like Rain. Complete Loose Lucy timing supercedes previous listing showing it cut at 4:59. Splice in Playing In The Band at 8:38.  Hard to tell how much is missing although it can't be more than a few minutes and could be only a few seconds.  Splice in Truckin' at 6:23. Could be a minute or two missing here. The first Eyes has quite a bit of exploratory jamming without dropping to that Dm riff (or whatever you want to call it), which is present to some degree in all other known '73 versions of the song.  Jerry plays the chord on the final notes of the song before changing to China Doll. By February 15, the change had been worked out.The cut in Wave that Flag at 1:25 is missing a full chorus after the second verse.

The tape breaks off during I Know You Rider after \"Wish I was a headlight\" and resumes during Looks Like Rain before \"Did you ever listen to the sound.\" China Cat Sunflower through Looks Like Rain circulates separately in the inferior AF to cover this cut (Bobby's guitar is very prominent on this master).

The 22-second cut in Eyes looks like a cassette tape flip introduced when the reels were transcribed to 1st gen cassette.  The missing conclusion of Here Comes Sunshine is harder to account for on this hypothesis, but there seems a reasonable chance that both missing segments are intact on the master reels.  Meanwhile...\r\n\r\nFirst set highlights include TLEO, Row Jimmy, GSET and China Cat >\r\nRider.  The Here Comes Sunshine times almost 16 minutes, is the longest known on circulating tape and probably the best.  The Dark Star is the third longest known at 43:28, and one of the all time best.  It is the fraternal twin of 11/11/73.Dave Greenberg did the patches.
