Transcribed by Teddy GoodBear:   ||||on the town||||  Lesson for the S.F. In the Mime Benefit  ||||by Ralph J. Gleason||||   the benefit for the San Francisco Mime troupe Friday night at the Fillmore  Auditorium (it was billed as \"Appeal II, for Continued Artistic Freedom in  the Arts\") was a roaring success. Over 3500 people paid $1.50 apiece to be  there.  But it was a great deal more than a benefit. It was substantiation of the  suspicion that the need to dance on the part of a great number of  residents of this area is so great it simply must be permitted.  The Friday night affair was basically a rock 'n roll dance such as the  ones the Family Dog put on at the Longshore Hall.  If this city was run for the citizens, such affairs would be commonplace  and conducted say, once a month at the Civic Auditorium where there used  to be numerous dances during the swing era.  * * *  At 9:30 there was a double line a block long outside the Fillmore  Auditorium. At 1 a.m. It was still there, the individuals were new but the  packed house still existed.  Inside a most remarkable assembladge of humanity was leaping, jumping,  dancing, frigging, fragging and frugging on the dance floor to the music  of the half dozen rock bands--The Mystery Trend, the Great Society, the  Jefferson Airplane, the VIP's, the Gentlemen's Band, the Warlocks and  others. The costumes were freeform Goodwill-cum-Sherwood Forest. Slim  young ladies with their faces painted a la Harper's Bazzar in  cats-and-dogs lines, granny dresses topped with hugh feathers, white hats  with decals of mystic design; bell-bottoms split up the side! the  combinations were seemingly limitless.  At each end of the huge hall was a three foot high sign saying LOVE. Over  the bar was another saying \"No Booze\", while the volunteer bartenders  served soft drinks. Alongside the regular bar was a series of tables  selling apples! the only dance (outside of Halloween) I've ever been at  where they sold apples, Craaaazy! in a corner past the apple table was a  baby in a carriage, sound asleep with a bottle and a Teddy bear clutched  in his (her?) arms.  This crowd was so far out that when Milton Hunt, the distinguished North  Beach boulevardier, entered wearing a scrape and a black sombrero and  escorting a girl dressed in a Vikki Duggins skirt (cut six inches below  the hipline and supported by a thin net top and that's all!) no one turned  a hair. It was that kind of a night.  Although it was a benefit for the Mime troupe in its fight against \"the  law's delay, the insolence of office\" to which their handest refers in  Shakesphearean terms, there were thousands there who never heard of the  Mime troupe or at least never had been in one of their shows, as Ronnie  Davis pointed out.  They were there for a multitude of reasons, and the reasons bear  examination. Some were there because the Mime troupe represents, along  with Jerry Ets Hotkins, a battle for creativity in the arts. Others, and  more I suspect, were there because the Mime troupe's park use hassle  dramatizes another aspect of the struggle of US against tHEM.  Still others were there as part of the rock revolution. They don't. need  booze (as the swing era dancers did). All they need is the sound of the  guitars. They get high on decibels alone. and they are hurting to dance.  * * *  SAN FRANCISCO has been hell on dances for years. The police obviously  regard mass proximity of the sexes to the sound of music as a hazard equal  to a time bomb. But I suspect this attitude will have to be tempered. The  actual demand for dances is going to increase. The whole rock revolution  points to dancing, the music ineluctably moves one to move.  Another thing about the Friday night revel. There were no guards inside.  There was an absence of uniforms and there was no trouble. It was the kind  of crowd were over a dozen people stopped dancing, got down on thier hands  and knees to help a girl find a contact lens that had popped out during a  particularly dramatic movement. They scrambled on the dance floor for a  few minutes and found it. She cleaned it in her mouth, popped it back in  and the dancing continued.
