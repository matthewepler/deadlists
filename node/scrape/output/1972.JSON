Like the man says ya'll gonna have to enunciate more clearly.  Or at least get together.  We don't do that tune no more man.  It done faded away in the mists of time.  Besides if ya'll shut up we can tune up easier. Thank you. (11) Lesh: As you all might have figured out by now we can't do any Pigpen songs because Pigpen ain't here.  The reason that Pigpen ain't here is because he's real sick and uh we know we can take all your good wishes home to him. He'll be back with us again next year as soon as the doctor tells him he can travel, concentrate, do all that heavy shit. (12) Garcia: It's another new tune here.  We're gonna get to that other stuff a little later. (13) Weir: Thank you.","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1972-07-18.sbd.lai.3348.shnf "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1972-07-18.sbd.miller.32878.flac16 "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1972-07-18.sbd.theotherwayne.88658.sbefail.shnf "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1972-07-18.sbd.unknown.9097.shnf "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd72-07-18.aud.weiner.5916.sbefail.shnf "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd72-07-18.sbd.cribbs.9067.sbeok.shn "}],"recordings":"240 SBD + AUDMaster recording source(s): 7inch Master Reels@7.5ips 1/2trk","contributors":["Richard Plumb"," Jim Powell"," Jeffrey Bednar"],"caretaker":{"name":"Richard Plumb","email":"billytell@yahoo.com"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"title":"The Promised Land","transition":";"},{"duration":"7:57","title":"Sugaree","transition":";"},{"duration":"6:23","title":"Black Throated Wind (1)","transition":";","commentRef":"1"},{"duration":"5:35","title":"Cumberland Blues (2)","transition":";","commentRef":"2"},{"duration":"5:45","title":"Me And Bobby McGee","transition":";"},{"duration":"6:55","title":"Loser","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:37","title":"Mexicali Blues (3)","transition":";","commentRef":"3"},{"duration":"5:45","title":"China Cat Sunflower","transition":">"},{"duration":"6:13","title":"I Know You Rider","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:23","title":"Beat It On Down The Line (4)","transition":";","commentRef":"4"},{"duration":"7:41","title":"Stella Blue","transition":";"},{"duration":"11:47","title":"Playing In The Band (5)","transition":";","commentRef":"5"},{"duration":"6:50#","title":"Tennessee Jed"}]},{"number":2,"songs":[{"duration":"6:29","title":"Casey Jones","transition":";"},{"duration":"0:52","title":"Weather Report Suite Prelude","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:58","title":"Me And My Uncle (6)","transition":";","commentRef":"6"},{"duration":"4:04","title":"Deal","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:01","title":"Jack Straw","transition":";"},{"duration":"8:22","title":"He's Gone","transition":";"},{"duration":"10:50","title":"Truckin' (7)","transition":">","commentRef":"7"},{"duration":"1:12","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"3:15","title":"Jam (8)","transition":">","commentRef":"8"},{"duration":"23:10","title":"The Other One","transition":">"},{"duration":"7:30","title":"Comes A Time","transition":";"},{"duration":"7:00","title":"Sugar Magnolia","transition":";"},{"duration":"6:26","title":"Ramble On Rose","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:21","title":"Goin' Down The Road Feeling Bad","transition":">"},{"duration":"3:19","title":"Not Fade Away"}]}],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Paramount Northwest Theatre","city":"Seattle","state":"WA","date":"1972-07-21T07:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1970s/19720721.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"The complete show except the Promised Land, with Sugaree, China Cat Sunflower and Ramble on Rose fragmentary (1) Before BT Wind Weir: this is an integral part of our show.

Billy Graham introduces the band before Playing In The Band indicating that it's probably the second set opener, not the first set closer as listed previously.  In addition there's no splice between Playing and He's Gone.  There is a splice in The Other One on both the AUD and the SBD. The AUD seems to be missing about 10 minutes following the Bass and Drum duet including the first verse.  The SBD is missing the Bass and Drum duet. (1) Lesh: Thank You. (2) Weir: Thank you.  We're going to take a short break, so everybody hang loose and we'll be back in a few minutes. (3) Bill Graham introduces band before Playing In The Band:  We bring them back again.  Please without any further ado, the Grateful Dead. (4) Bob Weir, just before Truckin': \"Hey, listen, is there anybody here from Turlock tonight?  [cheers]  When you're in love, the whole world is from Turlock, right?\" (5) Timing of Truckin>The Other One: Truckin' {5:11} > Truckin' Jam {2:42} > NBFM Jam {1:00} >Bass and Drum Solo {3:17} tape cut > The Other One {5:06} > Second Verse {1:03} (6) Weir: \"Thank you\".  There's applause after Sugar Magnolia that sounds as if the set has ended.  Audience members are screaming more and then the tape cuts.  (7) Right before GDTRFB Weir says:  I'll take this opportunity to tell you all a story about what happened to me when I was walking down the street in New York City.  I was walking into my hotel.  I was walking down the street and coming down the other side of the street was this guy with this cigar box.  And the cigar box was kind of buzzing and humming.  Making all sorts fo noise, all kind of noise and uh and so I stopped him and I asked him, \"Pardon me sir.  What do you got in that box?  I mean you know it's making all that noise, humming and buzzing.\"  And he said, \"Well this is my bee collection.  It's a collection of bees.\" I said, \"That's a bee collection?\"  \"Yes I have ten thousand bees in here.\", he said.  I said, \"Well you got ten thousand bees in there.  Don't they all get crushed?\"  He said, \"Well fuck 'em.\" (8) Goin' Down The Road Feeling Bad does not contain the usual And We Bid You Good Night Jam, it's cut after a couple of notes.
