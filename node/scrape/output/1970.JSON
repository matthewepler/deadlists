Long Black Limousine is Jerry and Bobby on acoustic guitars, Phil tries to play but drops out after his amp continues to sputter static.  Jerry switches to electric with Sawmill.  After The Race Is On Jerry announces that \"we're going to take a break within the break -- we're still working on Phil's bass frantically in the background.\"Apparently the problem remained unsolved because when the next set begins it is still just Jerry and Bobby acoustic.  Pigpen does Katie Mae and Phil joins in on vocals for Cumberland.  Before Cumberland Jerry can be heard proposing that they do Cumberland first, then Uncle John to end the set.  The tape breaks off after Cumberland, however.  It seems possible that this represents the entire Dead performance for this date, although normally you'd expect more electric Dead.

Feb. 5-8, 1970) the Dead played one long set each night, as is clear from the tapes of 2/6/70 and as Michael Parrish, who attended the shows, confirms.Garcia plays pedal steel guitar on Seasons and The Race Is On.There are two different tapes from 2/5/70, a 31:07 minute AUD tape and a 42 minute SBD.  The first 5 songs listed are they AUD tape.  They appear as filler on the 2/08/70 AUD tape.  Probably Mason's Children follows Boss Man and Black Peter.  David Hollister, who finally sorted out the identity of Seasons and The Race Is On, thinks that they may belong after Mason's; my guess is they came before, but this is unclear from the tapes.  During the pause before Mason's Children various audience members call out for songs and Bobby responds \"Just relax and take what you get.\"  Mason's plainly was not a set opener.  In the pause after Mason's the tuning sounds like Cryptical might be next, and I have supplemented the list from the tapes based on this assumption.The 41:43 SBD tape begins with the first 7:00 of Mason's Children, breaks off, then resumes with The Eleven already well under way.  Probably this is the conclusion of the show, and Uncle John was probably encore.DeadBase IX lists a China Cat > Rider as well.

There is a cut of uncertain proportions at 3:23 of Lovelight.Taj Mahal and Bigfoot were also on the bill (DeadBase IX).Eaton lists:02/06/70 The Fillmore West, San Francisco Ca - complete  4.8, 114min, Sbd, A1D0, Reel M->Cass 1->Dat 0, 48k,  7inch Master Reel@7.5ips 1/2trk->Tascam 122mkIII Cass 1st Gen->3800 x 0","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-02-06.sbd.bean.3913.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"115 SBMaster recording source(s): 7inch Master Reel@7.5ips 1/2trk","contributors":["Jim Powell  Rob Eaton  Michael Parrish  David Hollister"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"title":"[1:25:12]","transition":";"},{"duration":"#4:11","title":"Green Green Grass of Home","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:56]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:40","title":"Sawmill","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:21]","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:42","title":"Seasons Of My Heart","transition":";"},{"title":"[2:00]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:12","title":"China Cat Sunflower","transition":">"},{"duration":"2:36","title":"Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"4:15","title":"I Know You Rider","transition":">"},{"duration":"6:59","title":"High Time","transition":";"},{"title":"[3:36]","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:00","title":"Big Boss Man","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:30]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:13","title":"Me And My Uncle","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:35]","transition":";"},{"duration":"7:54","title":"Hard To Handle","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:26]","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:28","title":"Cold Rain And Snow","transition":">"},{"duration":"10:07","title":"Uncle John's Band","transition":">"},{"duration":"9:57","title":"Black Peter","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:06]","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:17]","transition":";"},{"duration":"1:39","title":"Good Lovin'","transition":">"},{"duration":"0:10","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"4:06#","title":"Good Lovin'"}]}],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Fillmore West","city":"San Francisco","state":"CA","date":"1970-02-07T08:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1970s/19700207.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"The timings given here are based on a composite of the AUD and SBD tapes.  Garcia plays pedal steel guitar on the first 3 tunes.  On the AUD tape Green Grass cuts in on \"as I step down from the train.\"  In the pause after Green Grass Jerry says with droll mock sarcasm \"And you thought you were gonna hear rock and roll.\" -- probably Green Grass opened the set.  In the pause after Sawmill Jerry Teases Me And My Uncle repeatedly, but after a splice they play Seasons Of My Heart instead and when they do come around to Me And My Uncle, it's without the pedal steel.  In the pause after Seasons Garcia shifts to electric guitar and they \"test the monitors;\" in the lengthy pause before Boss Man they again try to get the monitors working properly; Bobby remarks on the \"jury-rigged house PA,\" observing that \"I hate to point the incriminating finger but I wish he'd leave his shit home.\" We are fortunate to have a fairly decent AUD tape of the first hour of this show, since the circulating SBD is rather cut up, with an additional 40 seconds missing from the beginning of Green Grass, nearly a minute missing from the end of Sawmill, 30 seconds lost from the beginning of Seasons, 15 seconds clipped from the beginning of Big Boss Man, Hard To Handle missing entirely, and 45 seconds clipped from the beginning of Cold Rain And Snow.  On the other hand the circulating AUD breaks off after the first 4 seconds of Uncle John's Band, while the SBD carries on into Good Lovin'.  For reference and comparison here is a timing of the circulating SBD:  Green Green Grass of Home [#3:39] ; [0:11] % [0:21] ; Sawmill [2:49#] % [0:06] % Seasons Of My Heart [#3:14] ; [2:01] ; China Cat Sunflower [3:11] > Jam [2:34] > I Know You Rider [4:15] > High Time [6:55] ; [0:31] % Big Boss Man [#4:45] ; [0:30] ; Me And My Uncle [3:11] ; [0:07] % Cold Rain And Snow [#4:46] > Uncle John's Band ... (timings from here on as above).Compared with Friday's total of 115 minutes and Sunday's of 138, the 85 minutes of Saturday 2/7/70 preserved on tape seems obviously to fall short by at least a half hour.

Bobby keeps singing Not Fade Away over the first 20 seconds of the Saint Stephen Jam; NFA is timed till the end of these vocals; the Stephen Reprise starts 20 seconds earlier and so actually runs 2:35, counting the overlap.On the set structure of these shows see 2/5/70 Comments.In his introduction Graham first presents \"Mr. Garcia\" with a \"photo of Michael J. Brody of RCA-Victor,\" and then gives this introduction:  \"Stars of stage, screen and radio, direct from a command performance in New Orleans, these are the Grateful Dead.\"  Bobby explains the pause after Smokestack:  \"We're waitin' for the Bear to turn on his lovelight\" -- then, after a blast of Feedback, \"He just did.\"  In the long tuning pause after Dire Wolf Phil Teases Lovelight and Jerry enjoins \"everybody just relax,\" several times.It is possible that one or more tunes are missing between It Hurts Me Too and Dark Star; it is also possible that nothing is missing here.The AUD tape has a cut at the end of Dark Star, in which the first 39 seconds of Saint Stephen are lost.  This looks like the taper taking the opportunity to flip; the AUD runs unbroken to the end of Lovelight after this cut.  The SBD tape in circulation begins 3:42 before the end of Dark Star and runs for 33:04, cutting off 15:12 into Lovelight; the AUD supplies the remaining 19:55 of Lovelight.  This odd scrap, too, suggests there was something unusual about the dimensions of the set.  There is a passage of Tighten Up Jam during Lovelight.The AUD tape of 2/8/70 usually circulates as 2 90-minute cassettes with filler from 2/05/70 (Seasons, The Race Is On, Mason's, Boss Man, Peter).

Total time  1:26:37 +.   Intro by Keeva Krystal.  Arthur Lee of Love adds percussion to the Dark Star.  The third guitarist audible starting about 2:30 into Dark Star and for several minutes thereafter is Peter Green.  Duane Allman on slide guitar enters around the middle of Dark Star.  Gregg Allman adds organ & vocals during Lovelight, and Barry Oakley plays a second bass on Lovelight. Richard Pipes believes Fleetwood Mac-member Danny Kirwan's guitar is also to be discerned in the background.  The encore is acoustic Dead, with only one acoustic guitar.  The timings are from the AUD supplemented by the SBD.  The Allman Bros and Love were also on the bill.There are also two SBDs in circulation.  The one that has circulated for many years starts 10:23 minutes into the Dark Star, with the best copies breaking off 3:41 before the end of the Lovelight (or cutting to an AUD patch); however, most copies of the SBD in circulation break off about a minute earlier.  Usually the beginning of this tape is patched in from the AUD.  Recently a new copy of a SBD has come into circulation.  It includes the entire Late Show but at 6:58 into the Dark Star it has a cut in which 3:52 is missing; there are also copies of this SBD in circulation with this cut patched from the AUD.  It also has a cut at 30:16 of Lovelight, with 0:27 missing; this also can be patched from the AUD.  Probably the older circulating SBD comes from the surreptitious master (see below) while the recent copy comes from the vault master (this is speculation, however).TAPES FROM FILLMORE EAST FEBRUARY 1970Reportedly it was during this Late Show that clever and industrious Fillmore East stagecrew members including John Chester and Alan Mande managed to patch a Revox reel-to-reel deck with 15-inch reels into the PA feed underneath the stage, and the moment when our circulating SBD tape picks up the Dark Star, 10:23 after its opening, is the moment when they managed to get their jury-rigged system up and running.  Circulating copies of this SBD master break off 3:41 before the end of the Lovelight; perhaps this cut is on the master.  In addition to this 45 minute from 2/11/70 our enterprising heroes taped the Late Shows on the 13th and 14th (but apparently not the Early Shows), and copies of these tapes have been in circulation since the early 70s.Bear also ran SBD masters of the 13th and 14th, and much of this material has now been released on Bear's Choice and Dick's Pick 4.  However, it is unclear whether there is any SBD from the 11th in the vault.  For the Dick's Picks 4 release, Jeffrey Norman patched gaps in the vault SBDs of the 13th and 14th using the surreptitious second SBD masters -- good karma all around.  The GD Records / Polygram Records CD, \"Allman Bros Band Fillmore East February 1970,\" (GDCD 4063) releases tape of the Allmans from this run and may contain tunes from this date.Recently, SBD tapes of the Early Shows from 2/13 and 2/14 have come into circulation, in FM and pre-FM copies.Besides the several SBDs from this run there are also two AUD tapes in circulation, one of the 2/11/70 Late Show and one of the 2/13/70 Early Show (see Comments under this date).  There is a complete copy of the 2/11/70 AUD master in circulation, and it also appears as patches for the first 10:23 of the Dark Star and last 3:41 of the Lovelight, otherwise missing on the older circulating SBD tape, and in patches of the missing 3:52 starting at 6:58 of the more recently circulated SBD.  The AUD of the 2/13/70 Early Show could easily be by the same taper as the 2/11/70 AUD.  Both tapes have strong saturation and strong bass, and both have decent but not perfect mic placement, and as a result boomy in the bass with considerable hall resonance and audience noise.  There is no evidence of AUD tape from the 14th in circulation.Eaton lists:02/11/70 The Fillmore East, New York City Ny - xcerpt  4.9, 115min, Sbd, A0D1, Reel M->Dat  1, 44k,  7inch Master Reels@15ips 1/2trk->3700 x 0->3700 x 1","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-02-11.late-partial.sbd.chester-mande.33335.sbefail.shnf "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-02-11.late-set2.aud.smith.99152.sbeok.flac16 "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-02-11.partial.sbd.greenberg-evans.28402.sbeok.flac16 "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-02-11.partial-late.aud.reynolds.gadsden.99052.flac16 "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-02-11.sbd.smith.patched.99154.sbeok.flac16 "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-02-11.sbd.warner.patched.28292.sbeok.flac16 "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-02-11.early-late.sbd.sacks.90.sbefail.shnf "}],"recordings":"90 A?  45 SBMaster recording source(s): 7inch Master Reels@15ips 1/2trk","contributors":["Jim Powell  Alan Mande  Steve Silberman  Kenny Schachat  Richard S.

Timings are based on the AUD tape supplemented by the SBD.  The AUD tape was mastered by Harry Ely.  This tape cuts in during the \"New Speedway Boogie Jam,\" which sounds like Bobby playing the comp to this song over & over while the audience claps along and the equipment crew tries to get the rest of the band up & running.  After 4:15 this cuts to another couple minutes of tuning, soundcheck activity and bitching about the sound system.  The show proper finally kicks in with Casey Jones, though the circulating SBD only starts with Big Boy Pete.  The circulating AUD is missing Me And My Uncle and I'm A King Bee, but they appear on the SBD.  On the AUD tape China Cat cuts in at \"kimono like a crazy-quilt star gown,\" and the 2nd stanza of Rider is clipped.  These defects aside, AUD tape is quite a decent job of audience recording.

Pigpen was frail and jaundiced, and had to rest in the dressing room during parts of the shows.\"  Spencer Wren, another audience member, recalls that Hammond opened, followed by NRPS with Jerry on pedal steel and Phil playing bass.SET 2 is electric Dead.  It may be that a tune or two featuring Bobby's vocals or Pigpen's is missing in the splices before and after Dire Wolf.  There is a Tighten Up Jam starting about 13 minutes into Dark Star.  The Jam during which the reel audibly runs out sounds like it's heading for Good Lovin'.  According to Wren, Pigpen and Hammond came out and Jammed by way of an encore after the Dead finished their electric set, around 1:30 AM.The Eleven analyzes   Saint Stephen > 1st vocals 1:05 > transition Jam 2:19 > Eleven Jam 3:08  > Eleven vocals 0:40 > Eleven Jam 4:57  > Eleven 2nd theme Jam 1:46 > Drums.This tape's fidelity leaves something to be desired for the first few minutes but by the beginning of Friend Of The Devil the taper gets his levels up (the PA levels come up during Rider) and thereafter this is fairly decent AUD tape, not dead on in the sweet spot but quite listenable.  It's possible the mics were repositioned before the electric set and/or before Dark Star.  Bill Ray reports that John Hammond opened.All of the listed tunes except the concluding fragment of Man's World have been in circulation for many years dated \"4/24/70.\"  Recently the Man's World fragment came into circulation, labeled as part of this same tape.  This list, however, strikingly resembles the list in the review of the next night (see Comments under 4/25/70), particularly with the addition of Man's World.  On the other hand the eyewitnesses appear to vouch for this list as the 24th.  Perhaps the show reviewed is misdated, or perhaps there is a mix-up in the dating of this tape, or of the fragment of Man's World.","downloadSources":[{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-04-24.aud.cotsman.9498.sbefail.shnf "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-04-24.aud.gillis.17685.sbeok.shnf "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-04-24.aud.hanno.19531.sbeok.shnf "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-04-24.aud.remaster.sirmick.27205.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"101 AF","contributors":["Jim Powell  Bill Ray  Michael Goetz  Stu Green  Spencer Wren  Dwight Holmes  Jeff Cotsman  Glenn Gillis  Uli Teute  Hanno Bunjes"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Mammoth Gardens","city":"Denver","state":"CO","date":"1970-04-25T08:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1970s/19700425.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"There is a rave review for the Saturday 4/25/70 show by Mike DeLong, \"Grateful Dead Stuns Crowd,\" in the Colorado Springs Sun for April 30, 1970.

Speaking to Dick Lawson in England around 5/24/70, Garcia said:\r\n\r\n\"We're going through some transitions. Our music is not what it was: it's continually changing. What we've been doing in the States lately is having like 'an evening with the Grateful Dead.' We start off with acoustic music with Bobby and I playing guitars, light Drums and very quiet electric bass. Pigpen plays the organ. Then we have a band we've been travelling with, The New Riders of the Purple Sage, where I play pedal steel, not guitar, Mickey plays Drums, and three of our friends from the coast, musicians that we've known for a long time, are fronting the band. So we start off with acoustic muisc and then The New Riders of the Purple Sage -- it's like very snappy electric country-rock; it's kinda hard to describe -- and then we come on with the electric Dead, so it keeps us all really interesting, and it's six hours of this whole development thing. By the end of the night it's very high.\"\r\n\r\n(Dick Lawson, \"What Will Be The Answer To The Answer Then?,\" Friends, 12 June 1970, p. 11)\r\n\r\nEaton lists:\r\n\r\n05/02/70 Harpur College, Binghampton Ny - complete\r\n4.8, 182min, Sbd, A0D1, Reel M->Dat 1, 44k,\r\n7inch Master Reel@7.5ips 1/2trk->3700 x 0->3800 x 1\r\n\r\nTotal time 4:01:11 + (including 05/02/70b SET 1).

Nelson plays mandolin on Cold Jordan and Marmaduke adds bass harmony vocals.Set One is the complete NRPS set, with Garcia on pedal steel guitar.

The complete set except The Weight appears on another circulating 90 SBD cassette, following the last six tunes of the 5/1/70 NRPS set; this cassette probably stems from a band work tape (see Comments under 05/01/70).

time  4:21:32 +.  These timings represent a composite of the two circulating AUD masters.  On the structure of mid-70 Dead shows see Comments under 05/02/70b.  SET 1 is acoustic Dead.  (1) Monitor check after I Know You Rider Jerry plays electric guitar on Cumberland and New Speedway Boogie, while Bobby continues on acoustic guitar.  Apparently David Nelson adds a second acoustic guitar to New Speedway and perhaps Cumberland, since Bobby & Jerry both introduce him after New Speedway; it is very difficult to pick out his guitar on the circulating tapes, however.SET 2 is NRPS with Garcia, pedal steel.  The cut in Fair Chance To Know is the tape flip; it's harder to figure what happened with the cut before Seasons -- it may not be on the master.  Somebody adds soaring harmony vocals to Last Lonely Eagle.  The Race Is On, Seasons, Mama Tried and Sawmill feature vocals by \"special guest star Bobby Ace, formerly of Bobby Ace And The Cards Off The Bottom.\"SET 3 is electric Dead.  By way of introduction to Dire Wolf Jerry says \"This is a little paranoid-in-the-streets mantra -- if you want to think of it that way.\"  Beat It On Down The Line gets 30 beats in response to an audience-member's reply to the question \"What's a good number?\" -- at first this query elicits cries for \"Alligator\" & Jerry replies \"He didn't mean that kind of number.  He meant the other kind of number -- you know, 'one, two...' .\"  The Jam after the Darkness Jam includes hints of NFA, Lovelight, Caution and the Saint Stephen Jam.  There was no encore.Together the two circulating AUD masters from this show present us with that rare thing, a recording of the (nearly) complete sequence of events at your typical mid-1970 3-set show (acoustic Dead - NRPS - electric Dead) -- and a generous high-energy show at that.  Circulating copies of the more nearly complete AUD master contain the entire show except a few cuts and glitches; notably, this master has several cuts in the NRPS set (listed above), is missing the first couple bars of Easy Wind, loses levels late in this tune, and is missing The Frozen Logger and the first 2:05 of the Drums > Not Fade Away.  There are at least two different copies of this master in circulation, one that's been around for more than a decade, marked by its omission of the NRPS set, and the other, apparently from a much more recent retranscription of the master, which includes the NRPS set.  The more complete version tends to be cleaner as well; the other glitches are on both copies & presumably on the master.The circulating copy of the second AUD master contains 70 minutes of excerpts from the electric Dead set, (#Cold Rain; Dire Wolf; Easy Wind; Beat It; High Time; That's It > Cosmic Charlie; I'm A King Bee; The Frozen Logger; and Not Fade Away, which breaks off near the end); this is sufficient to cover all the electric set flaws on the first master but offers no help with the NRPS set.  Both masters make very listenable AUD tape.  The mics for the more nearly complete master were placed further back; it has more audience noise on it, including the group among whom it was recorded, who have quite an amusing party but manage to be quiet during songs.  The 70 minute excerpts tape has much less audience noise, and a crisp bass; the mics were much closer in, and this tape sometimes circulates mislabeled \"SBD.\"","downloadSources":[{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-05-07.aud.sirmick.32276.sbeok.flac16 "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-05-07.aud.weiner-gdADT04.5439.sbefail.shnf "}],"recordings":"262 A?  70 AF","contributors":["Jim Powell  Joan Bailey  Tony Toscano"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"title":"Dark Star","transition":">"},{"title":"Dancing In The Street","transition":";"},{"title":"Good Lovin'","transition":";"},{"title":"Uncle John's Band"}]}],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Farrell Hall, SUCNY","city":"Delhi","state":"NY","date":"1970-05-08T07:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1970s/19700508.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"NRPS was also on the bill\r\n\r\n","downloadSources":[{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-05-08.aud.miller.32056.sbeok.flacf "}],"recordings":"(Stage) Unknown Mic -> Cassettte Master\r\nTransfer Info:\r\nCassette Master (Sony TC-WE475) -> Sony R500 (Pass Through) ->\r\nSEK'D Prodif Plus -> Samplitude Professional v8.01 -> FLAC\r\n(1 Disc Audio / 1 Disc FLAC)","contributors":["Jim Powell"," Doug Lantelme"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"title":"[22:36]","transition":";"},{"duration":"0:40","title":"Intro","transition":";"},{"duration":"6:31","title":"Deep Elem Blues","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:17]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:30","title":"Friend Of The Devil","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:17]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:52","title":"Silver Threads And Golden Needle","transition":">"},{"duration":"6:52","title":"Black Peter","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:39  announcement]"}]}],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute","city":"Worcester","state":"MA","date":"1970-05-09T07:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1970s/19700509.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"SET 1 is acoustic Dead, the beginning of the set.

On the structure of mid-70 Dead shows see Comments under 05/02/70b.  SET 1 is acoustic Dead.  Throughout the first five tunes they are plagued by monitor sound problems and the pauses between songs are full of efforts to fix them.  After Candyman Bobby says \"Jerry broke a string, and so, we're gonna do some more relaxin'.\"  On the circulating tape this is followed by a splice, after which Sam Cutler comes up on the PA and says \"Can Bob Matthews come up on stage and sort out the sound system which isn't working.\"  After another splice the NRPS set opener follows (SET 2).  It's hard to guess whether there are acoustic tunes missing after Candyman.  The NRPS set is substantially complete except for most of Henry and most of The Weight.  (Some copies have the 5/1/70 SBD Little Susie and Uncle John's as fill on II B -- not to be mistaken for part of the missing acoustic set of 5/14/70.)SET 2 is the NPRS set with Garcia, pedal steel.  After Whatcha Gonna Do someone asks Jerry if it's OK, then announces \"Alright we're gonna open the back doors and let everybody else in free.\"  Monitor level problems continue during this set.  (1) Marmaduke introduces Henry as \"our dope-smuggler song -- it's a fantasy.\"  The tape cuts 33 seconds into this tune; when the signal resumes they are yet again trying to get the monitors and PA working right.  Marmaduke wonders if the theatrical lighting is drawing power off the PA & suggests turning it down.  2 minutes later they restart Henry but this version too fades down incomplete.  After another splice Garden Of Eden begins.  After Lodi the drummer starts Honky Tonk Women but the band doesn't follow, he drops it, they pause, then start The Weight instead (which cuts off after only 13 seconds on the circulating tapes).  Both tunes were set-closers for NRPS; they might have closed this set with The Weight or gone on to close with Honkytonk.  These various cuts aside (some arising from technical difficulties at the show), the tape in circulation appears to represent a complete set.  It seems possible the master includes the rest of The Weight.SET 3 is electric Dead.  There are two circulating sources for this show's electric set, an 80 minute SBD and a 45 minute FM-SBD.  The 45 FM-SBD contains Casey Jones % China Cat > Rider % Mama Tried > High Time % Good Lovin' % Good Morning Little Schoolgirl.  The 80 minute circulating SBD tape has the entire electric set except China Cat > Rider, Good Lovin', and Dire Wolf, with the sequence of tunes misarranged before Cold Rain.  David Gans reports this sequence as the contents of vault reels 3, 4 & 5.The encore is with David Nelson, mandolin, and Marmaduke, bass vocals; it does not appear on the circulating tapes.Eaton lists:05/14/70 Merramec College, Kirkwood Mo - complete  4.7, 150min, Sbd, A1D0, Reel M->Cass 1->Dat 0, 48k  7inch Master Reels@7.5ips 1/2trk->Tascam 122mkIII Cass 1st Gen->3800 x 0","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-05-14.sbd.cotsman.24223.shnf "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-05-14.sbd.warner-evans.28716.sbeok.flac16 "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-05-14.sbd-acoustic.clugston.34165.sbeok.shnf "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-05-14.sbd-electric.clugston.7604.shnf "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-05-14.set2-partial.sbd.browning.97548.sbeok.flac16 "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-05-14.sbd.cotsman.12439.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"190 SBMaster recording source(s): 7inch Master Reels@7.5ips 1/2trk","contributors":["Jim Powell   Gordon Sharpless citing Ed Lammer  David Gans  Dick Latvala   Rob Eaton"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"title":"[58:21]","transition":";"},{"duration":"0:58","title":"Intro","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:52","title":"Don't Ease Me In","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:58]","transition":";"},{"duration":"7:56","title":"I Know You Rider","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:06]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:06","title":"The Rub","transition":";"},{"title":"[3:08]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:16","title":"Friend Of The Devil","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:32]","transition":";"},{"duration":"4:30","title":"Long Black Limousine","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:53]","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:23","title":"Candyman","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:41]","transition":";"},{"duration":"4:27","title":"Cumberland Blues","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:22]","transition":";"},{"duration":"6:00","title":"New Speedway Boogie","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:46]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:30","title":"Cold Jordan","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:51]"}]},{"number":2,"songs":[{"title":"[45:04]","transition":";"},{"duration":"1:23","title":"Intro","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:33","title":"Six Days On The Road","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:44]","transition":";"},{"duration":"4:09","title":"Watcha Gonna Do","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:33]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:50","title":"I Don't Know You","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:33]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:25","title":"Henry","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:31]","transition":";"},{"duration":"4:30","title":"Portland Woman","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:20]","transition":";"},{"duration":"4:11","title":"Fair Chance To Know","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:45]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:01#","title":"Last Lonely Eagle","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:00","title":"Mama Tried","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:09]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:22","title":"Sawmill","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:39]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:35","title":"Me And My Uncle","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:25]","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:06","title":"Connection","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:10]","transition":"%"},{"title":""}]},{"number":3,"songs":[{"title":"[59:04]","transition":";"},{"duration":"0:06","title":"Intro","transition":";"},{"duration":"4:20","title":"Casey Jones","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:30]","transition":";"},{"duration":"7:52","title":"Easy Wind","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:13","title":"Attics Of My Life","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:22]","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:49","title":"Saint Stephen","transition":">"},{"duration":"1:56","title":"Cryptical Envelopment","transition":">"},{"duration":"6:54","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"11:09","title":"The Other One","transition":">"},{"duration":"4:22","title":"Cryptical Envelopment","transition":">"},{"duration":"7:31","title":"Cosmic Charlie"}]},{"number":"encore","songs":[{"duration":"2:28","title":"Tuning","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:20","title":"New Minglewood Blues","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:54]"}]}],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Fillmore East","city":"New York","state":"NY","date":"1970-05-15T07:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1970s/19700515.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"This is the Early Show.

One wonders if this other master could also complete the Eagle, which usually features a big pedal steel solo.  SET 3 is electric Dead.  Before Saint Stephen Pigpen says \"Alright you people, you know who you are.\"  Enterprising Fillmore East stagecrew patched a reel-to-reel machine underneath the stage into the PA feed and saved most of this show for us and eternity.  They were busy setting up for the Early Show electric Dead set and blew their flip during the Early Show NRPS set, losing the second half of that set as a result, but the rest of this enormous evening's proceedings are recorded in their entirety.  The master has only the left channel through the middle of Candyman (there are also splitter-generated 2-channel mono copies circulating).  Around 4 hours of this show were broadcast by KPFA-FM Berkeley in 1971, further speeding the propagation of this tape (some early FM copies are dated \"6/21/71;\" this may be the date of the broadcast).  For many years 5/15/70 was THE representative 1970 Dead tape -- Harpur College 5/2/70 and Winterland Arena 10/4/70 its only rivals for wide circulation.  Recently a version of the NRPS set for this Early Show has come into circulation, as noted above, apparently supplemented by a second SBD master, presumably from the vault.","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd_nrps70-05-15.sbd.reynolds-kaplan.29473.shnf "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-05-15.early-late.sbd.97.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"360 SB (total for 05/15/70a&b)Master recording source(s): 10inch Master Reels@7.5ips 1/2trk","contributors":["Jim Powell  Alan Mande"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"title":"[45:24]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:25","title":"The Ballad Of Casey Jones","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:40]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:29","title":"Silver Threads And Golden Needle","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:20]","transition":";"},{"duration":"7:01","title":"Black Peter","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:24]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:47","title":"Friend Of The Devil","transition":";"},{"title":"[2:00]","transition":";"},{"duration":"6:18","title":"Uncle John's Band","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:32]","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:05","title":"Candyman","transition":";"},{"title":"[2:16  Intro]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:40","title":"She's Mine","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:17] Katie Mae [4:00]","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:26]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:41","title":"A Voice From On High","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:09]"}]},{"number":2,"songs":[{"title":"[1:15:26]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:22","title":"Intro","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:51","title":"Brown Eyed Handsome Man","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:32]","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:50","title":"Louisiana Lady","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:26]","transition":";"},{"duration":"4:38","title":"Can't Pay The Price","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:04]","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:33","title":"Truck Drivin' Man","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:30]","transition":";"},{"duration":"7:34","title":"All I Ever Wanted","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:51]","transition":";"},{"duration":"4:10","title":"Workin' Man Blues","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:42]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:27","title":"Henry","transition":";"},{"title":"[3:34  broken string]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:52","title":"I Don't Know You","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:25]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:45","title":"Lodi","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:38]","transition":";"},{"duration":"6:05","title":"Last Lonely Eagle","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:45]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:58","title":"Mama Tried","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:09]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:#09","title":"Sawmill","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:09]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:32","title":"Me And My Uncle","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:26]","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:10","title":"Connection","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:21]"}]},{"number":3,"songs":[{"title":"[[1:55:50 +]]","transition":";"},{"duration":"0:06","title":"Intro (1)","transition":";","commentRef":"1"},{"duration":"2:24","title":"China Cat Sunflower","transition":">"},{"duration":"2:06","title":"Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"4:13","title":"I Know You Rider","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:09]","transition":";"},{"duration":"4:45","title":"Cumberland Blues","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:02]","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:05","title":"Hard To Handle","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:41]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:47","title":"Beat It On Down The Line","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:47]","transition":";"},{"duration":"10:25","title":"Morning Dew","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:30]","transition":";"},{"duration":"0:58","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"1:49","title":"Good Lovin'","transition":">"},{"duration":"3:13","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"7:01","title":"Good Lovin'","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:12]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:42","title":"Dire Wolf","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:39]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:21","title":"Next Time You See Me","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:21]","transition":"%"},{"duration":"19:29","title":"Dark Star","transition":">"},{"duration":"4:#02","title":"Saint Stephen","transition":">"},{"duration":"0:25","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"6:28","title":"Not Fade Away","transition":">"},{"duration":"26:#16","title":"Turn On Your Lovelight"}]},{"number":"encore","songs":[{"title":"[8:44]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:52","title":"Tuning","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:15","title":"Cold Jordan","transition":";"},{"title":"[2:37]"}]}],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Fillmore East","city":"New York","state":"NY","date":"1970-05-15T07:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1970s/19700515.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"This is the Late Show.  Late show total time 3:58:55 +.  Early & Late Shows total time 6:33:29 +.  SET 1 is the Late Show acoustic Dead set complete.  David Nelson plays mandolin on A Voice From On High and Marmaduke adds bass vocals.  SET 2 is the complete Late Show NRPS set with Garcia, pedal steel.  Bob Weir guests on vocals for Mama Tried, Sawmill and Me And My Uncle.  There is a brief cut in Sawmill, with less than 10 seconds lost.  After this set the master contains 15:13 of continuing signal, comprising parts of Side B of Abbey Road (playing on the PA during the break) interspersed with the sounds of the stage being rigged -- Drums nailed down, etc -- followed by the sounds of tuning up.  SET 3 is electric Dead.  (1) Bill Graham Intro.  Beat It On Down The Line gets 14 beats.  In the pause after Next Time You See Me Pigpen says, in response to an audience request for Alligator, \"Don't be hollerin no emergency warnings in a place like this.  An alligator in here could chomp off a buncha feet.\"  Phil meanwhile is teasing Dark Star.  Just before the cassette side cuts off, Jerry Teases the introductory riff of Attics.  When the tape resumes on the next cassette Dark Star begins.  From the tape it's impossible to tell whether or not in the interval they repeated Attics from the Early Show but it seems likelier that they didn't.  There is a cut 2:17 into Saint Stephen; probably around 60 - 90 seconds are missing here.  There is a cut 13:33 into Lovelight, but probably only a few seconds are lost.  Over the last year it has been rumored that there is another SBD master of this show in the vault, which includes the rest of the Early Show NRPS set (and which would probably allow us to patch the few other glitches on the circulating master); however, nothing has emerged besides rumors thus far.  Meanwhile, we owe an enormous debt of gratitude to those resourceful Fillmore East crewmembers who took the bull by the horns and MADE TAPE.

Timings are from a combination of the AUD and the SBD.  Several bandmembers said this was the coldest audience they ever played for, and you can feel them straining mightily to finally achieve liftoff over the 33:14 span of the showclosing Lovelight.  A bit more than a minute into the Attics someone (Phil?) can be heard in the left channel calling out \"E -- E chord\" to Pigpen -- Attics was still new.  There is a Tighten Up Jam starting about 3:30 into Dark Star.  There is a Dancin Tease at 18:03 into Dark Star.  There is a cut 23:16 into the Lovelight on the AUD, probably a tape flip, with 20-40 seconds lost.  The AUD tape contains the complete show.  The newly circulating SBD of the entire show has the first 30 seconds of Casey Jones clipped.  It also has a cut at 3:24 of Saint Stephen, with 26 seconds missing.This was the Dead's first overseas show (they played Canada in '67).

Early Show.  As far as we know this tape only circulates labeled \"Capitol Theater, Port Chester 3/20/70 Early Show.\"  However, Gary Lambert notices that the Intro on the tape (by the show's producer, Howard Stein) goes \"Ladies and Gentlemen, the Capitol is proud to have back ... The Grateful Dead\" -- and points out that the shows on March 20 and 21st were the Dead's first run at this venue, the June shows their return.  Dwight Holmes has studied solos from this tape in comparison with other performances from Spring and from Summer, and says this supports dating the tape to June.  The Good Lovin', too, is more suggestive of June than March.  Altogether the case seems strong for re-dating this tape, and we now list it here as the June 24 Early Show electric set.  It would still be nice to turn up corroborating evidence.The Capitol Theater's ads for the Dead shows on 6/24/70 read:  \"Wednesday, June 24  |  8 PM & Midnight / 3 hours with  |  GRATEFUL DEAD  |  Alone with no other act.\"  Apparently in June the New Riders weren't yet considered an \"other act,\" since we have one of their sets from the evening -- and indeed at this point, with Jerry on pedal steel full time and Phil & one of the drummers often taking part as well, and Bobby a more than occasional guest vocalist, the two bands were not yet completely differentiated.  It is clear from the tapes that the Late Show on June 24th consisted of the classic 3-set Dead show of mid-70 (acoustic Dead -- NRPS -- electric Dead).  It is not clear whether the Early Show also had this structure or whether it consisted solely of a single electric set -- the tape listed here.  (It is just possible that the fragment of a NRPS set listed below as from the Late Show is actually from the Early.)This is quite a good job of AUD taping.  There is a tape-flip 9:51 into the Good Lovin' sequence; side B begins with the concluding vocals and runs 1:21; probably less than a minute is lost here and probably this flip is not on the master.  It also seems likely that the master contains a complete copy of the encore.","downloadSources":[{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd_nrps70-06-24.aud.pcrp5.23062.sbeok.flacf "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-06-24.124175.cooper.berger.flac16 "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-06-24.aud.cooper.coopernicus.32710.flac16 "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-06-24.aud.lai.7467.sbefail.shnf "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-06-24.aud.lee.5339.sbeok.shnf "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-06-24.aud.unknown.gadsden-reynolds.100223.flac16 "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-06-24.late.aud.harlan.9330.sbefail.shnf "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-06-24.late-partial.aud.moore.berger.98880.flac16 "}],"recordings":"70 AF","contributors":["Jim Powell  Joey Newlander  Gary Lambert  Dwight Holmes"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"title":"[27:00]","transition":";"},{"duration":"0:59","title":"Intro (1)","transition":";","commentRef":"1"},{"duration":"3:15","title":"Big Railroad Blues","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:50]","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:20","title":"Deep Elem Blues","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:44  intro]","transition":";"},{"duration":"1:40","title":"Monkey And The Engineer","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:46]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:22","title":"The Rub","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:59]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:12#","title":"Silver Threads And Golden Needle","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:28","title":"Friend Of The Devil","transition":"%"},{"duration":"5:31","title":"Candyman","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:19]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:03#","title":"Cumberland Blues","transition":"%"},{"duration":"0:51#","title":"Cold Jordan"}]},{"number":2,"songs":[{"title":"[29:44]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:20","title":"Six Days On The Road","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:56]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:20","title":"Superman","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:21]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:10","title":"I Don't Know You","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:24]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:58","title":"Fair Chance To Know","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:25]","transition":";"},{"duration":"4:35","title":"Portland Woman","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:34]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:02#","title":"Garden Of Eden","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:26","title":"Henry","transition":"%"},{"duration":"1:18#","title":"All I Ever Wanted"}]},{"number":3,"songs":[{"title":"[1:14:41]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:36","title":"Intro (2)","transition":";","commentRef":"2"},{"duration":"0:13","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"11:38","title":"Not Fade Away","transition":">"},{"duration":"7:54","title":"Easy Wind","transition":";"},{"title":"[2:18 broken string]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:18","title":"Me And My Uncle","transition":";"},{"title":"[2:#16 intro]","transition":";"},{"duration":"10:20","title":"Dark Star","transition":">"},{"duration":"5:34","title":"Attics Of My Life","transition":">"},{"duration":"7:48","title":"Dark Star","transition":">"},{"duration":"1:43","title":"Sugar Magnolia","transition":">"},{"duration":"3:01","title":"Dark Star","transition":">"},{"duration":"6:13","title":"Saint Stephen","transition":">"},{"duration":"3:02","title":"China Cat Sunflower","transition":">"},{"duration":"2:05","title":"Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"4:17","title":"I Know You Rider","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:25]"}]},{"number":"encore","songs":[{"title":"[14:10]","transition":";"},{"duration":"0:58","title":"Tuning","transition":";"},{"duration":"6:46","title":"Uncle John's Band","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:07]","transition":"%"},{"duration":"2:24","title":"Tuning (3)","transition":"%","commentRef":"3"},{"duration":"0:35","title":"Tuning","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:08","title":"Swing Low Sweet Chariot","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:10]"}]}],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Capitol Theater","city":"Port Chester","state":"NY","date":"1970-06-24T07:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1970s/19700624.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"Total time 2:15:35 +.  SET 1 is acoustic Dead. (1) Whooping contest.  \"Pigpen's off making friends with some honey.\"  Introduction. Pigpen's harmonica is prominent on several tunes.  Jerry plays electric guitar on Cumberland Blues.  David Nelson plays mandolin on Cold Jordan and Marmaduke adds bass vocals.  It's probable there are songs missing in the splices between songs during the 2nd half of the set and after Cold Jordan.  The first 5 songs also circulate labeled \"3/20/70 Early Show;\" this seems very unlikely, however -- see Comments under 3/20/70a.  SET 2 is the first 8 songs of a NRPS set with Garcia, pedal steel; we are missing 2-8 more songs to conclude the set.  The taper has trouble with his mics at several points (notice the cuts, too) and this may be all of the set this taper managed to record.  Probably this is the same taper as the acoustic set, but he has moved his mics.  The acoustic set is a fairly decent job of taping, but this approaches prime. SET 3 is an electric set.  (2) Mountain Jam tuning.This could be the complete set or possibly one or more songs could be missing after Me And My Uncle.  It sounds as if the mics were moved before Dark Star; after Me And My Uncle the recording is truly excellent.  There is a Tighten Up Jam in Dark Star before Sugar Mag.  Phil starts to go into High Time at the end of Rider but pulls up short immediately.  It seems clear they ended the set here, however.  (3) 2nd Encore.  After the first encore lengthy cheering over Judy Collins' recording of Richard Farina's Pack Up Your Sorrows playing on the PA finally yields a second encore. Swing Low Sweet Chariot is acoustic Dead with Marmaduke bass vocals & David Nelson, mandolin.  An anonymous lady provides harmony vocal accompaniment from rather close to the mics during much of the second encore, alternately disconcerting and endearing.There is a tape in circulation sometimes mislabeled \"Capitol Theater, Port Chester 6/24/70 Late Show,\" sometimes \"Capitol Theater, Port Chester 6/24/70 Early Show,\" and sometimes \"Capitol Theater, Port Chester 6/25/70\" this is actually Fillmore East 7/10/70.

Howard Mott, who atended this show, notes that it was part of a 2-day festival, with Janis and the Band playing on the 4th.  On the 3rd, he remembers the Dead-NRPS show running about 4 hours in all.  Eric Anderson was one of the opening acts.  He remarks that Bobby and Phil as well as Jerry took part in the NRPS set.  The tunes listed are the titles he recalls.  Lovelight was of course the set closer.According to Ihor Slabicky circulating video tape copies of Festival Express film footage show the Don't Ease from this show (daytime) , the New Speedway Boogie (electric), and the Hard To Handle.  The video also contains a C.C. Rider from this show (nightime) from an all-star Jam.  Slabicky lists personnel as follows:  Garcia is playing his red Gibson, Kreutzmann on tambourine, Sylvia Tyson of The Great Speckled Bird on vocals with other members of this band Jim Colegrove on bass, Buddy Cage on pedal steel, N.D. Smart on Drums, and Amos Garrett on lead guitar, Delaney Bramlett on guitar, the organ player from Delaney and Bonnie's group, and Ian Tyson on acoustic guitar.  C.C. Rider is followed by Will The Circle Be Unbroken, with Bonnie Bramlett on vocals.It has been claimed that there was a free concert following this show during which Janis joined the Dead for Lovelight.  Perhaps the all-star Jam Slabicky refers to comes from this free concert, since he identifies it as night-time footage.The circulating SBD of Janis's set from Toronto 6/27/70 has as filler two songs listed as from a Calgary 7/4/70 show.Dwight Holmes reports that he waited in line for a show at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago on 7/5/70, where it was announced around 5:00 PM that the Dead had cancelled.","downloadSources":[],"recordings":"none in circulation 10/00","contributors":["Jim Powell  Dwight Holmes  Howard Mott  Ihor Slabicky"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[],"band":"New Riders Of The Purple Sage","venue":"The Matrix","city":"San Francisco","state":"CA","date":"1970-07-07T07:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1970s/19700707.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"On page 162 of the Art Of Rock the poster for this show is reproduced.

Easy Wind is probably from the 9th; it differs from the versions circulating for the other nights of the run.  The intro prefixed proves it an opener.  Workin' Man Blues, which precedes it on the circulating tape, may therefore also belong to the 9th, but could come from the 10th or 12th.  FOTD could be either the 9th or the 10th.  SET 1 is from an acoustic Dead set, SET 2 from the NRPS set, possibly the opener, and SET 3 the opener of the electric Dead set.David Ross recalls attending a show from this run, apparently the 9th.  He remembers that among other songs they played \"a Dire Wolf with Jerry on pedal steel guitar during one of the acoustic sets, and an Uncle John's Band...  a Casey Jones, a Dark Star and a Morning Dew.\"  His phrase, \"one of the acoustic sets,\" probably reflects how difficult it was to tell the acoustic Dead sets from NRPS in 1970.  The four July 70 Fillmore East shows were \"Midnight Shows.\"  The concert started at midnight each night and consisted of an acoustic Dead set, a NRPS set, and an electric set.  DeadBase IX gives this (obviously incomplete) list for the 9th:  [acoustic]  Silver Threads And Golden Needle; Cumberland Blues; Dire Wolf; Swing Low Sweet Chariot; [electric]  Easy Wind; Casey Jones; Not Fade Away > Good Lovin'; Viola Lee Blues; Morning Dew; Sittin' On Top Of The World; Uncle John's Band.","downloadSources":[],"recordings":"none in circulation 10/00 (except as noted)","contributors":["Jim Powell  Joey Newlander  Dave Ross  Jim Hecht"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"title":"[1:15:26]","transition":";"},{"duration":"6:01","title":"Cold Rain And Snow","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:15","title":"Me And My Uncle","transition":">"},{"duration":"8:45","title":"Easy Wind","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:58","title":"New Minglewood Blues","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:48","title":"Alligator","transition":">"},{"duration":"6:25","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"6:39","title":"The Other One","transition":">"},{"duration":"6:26","title":"Attics Of My Life","transition":">"},{"duration":"4:22","title":"The Other One","transition":">"},{"duration":"1:23","title":"Cryptical Envelopment","transition":">"},{"duration":"6:53","title":"Cosmic Charlie","transition":"%"},{"duration":"0:41","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"2:14","title":"Good Lovin'","transition":">"},{"duration":"2:26","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"3:09","title":"China Cat Sunflower","transition":">"},{"duration":"3:28","title":"Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"4:26","title":"I Know You Rider","transition":">"},{"duration":"2:11","title":"Good Lovin'"}]},{"number":"encore","songs":[{"title":"[10:53]","transition":";"},{"duration":"10:13","title":"Not Fade Away "}]}],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Fillmore East","city":"New York","state":"NY","date":"1970-07-10T07:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1970s/19700710.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"See Comments under 07/09/70 on the structure of this concert.

See Comments under 07/09/70 on the structure of this show.  This list and the timings are based on Kenny Schachat's AUD tape of the show; his mics were about 15 rows back in the center orchestra and the tapes are in the A minus range for the period.  As often on masters from this period, tape pauses between nearly every tune (\"to save batteries\").  There are also copies of another master in circulation, containing the second half of the acoustic set, and nearly all the electric set with the sequence completely scrambled.  Circulating copies are higher generation and it's difficult to tell how kind the master itself might sound.  The New Minglewood Blues appearing at the end of Side A of the 1st cassette of the 2nd AUD master is actually filler from 7/10/70.  Bart Wise says that R.T.Carlyle mastered one of the AUDs for this date, so perhaps this 2nd AUD master is his.  SET 1 is acoustic Dead.  David Nelson plays mandolin on Rosalie McFall, A Voice From On High, Cold Jordan and Swing Low Sweet Chariot.  Jerry plays electric guitar on New Speedway, but Bobby still acoustic.  So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad) is an Everly Brothers tune.  Marmaduke contributes bass vocals to the gospel tunes.SET 2 is NRPS with Garcia, pedal steel.  This seems a little short to be the complete set, but at 2:00 AM apparently it was.SET 3 is the electric Dead set, apparently complete.  The Not Fade Away is expansively Jammed out.  There are Mountain Jam allusions around 6:00 and for several minutes starting around 8:00 they weave The Other One in and out of Not Fade.In the last couple years some people have argued that our tapes and lists for 7/11/70 and 7/12/70 are switched.  As I see it the strongest evidence against this argument is that there are two different AUD masters in circulation, both generally labeled \"7/11/70.\"   It is for this reason that I believe our tapes and lists for these dates are correct as given here.There is at least one bogus tape in circulation mislabeled with this venue & date.","downloadSources":[{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-07-11.aud.cotsman.9379.sbefail.shnf "}],"recordings":"225 AF  135 A?","contributors":["Jim Powell  David Scott Allan  Mike Dolgushkin  Joey Newlander  Kenny Schachat  Bart Wise"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"title":"[45:34]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:27","title":"Dire Wolf","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:48]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:29","title":"The Rub","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:29]","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:09","title":"How Long Blues","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:13]","transition":"%"},{"duration":"1:43","title":"Dark Hollow","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:52","title":"Friend Of The Devil","transition":"%"},{"duration":"6:10","title":"Candyman","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:23  Intro]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:47","title":"Katie Mae","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:12]","transition":";"},{"duration":"1:07","title":"Bring Me My Shotgun","transition":">"},{"duration":"2:44","title":"She's Mine","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:16]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:15","title":"Rosalie McFall","transition":"%"},{"duration":"2:44","title":"Tell It To Me","transition":"%"},{"duration":"2:34","title":"Wake Up Little Susie","transition":"%"},{"duration":"4:01","title":"Cumberland Blues"}]},{"number":2,"songs":[{"title":"[45:54]","transition":";"},{"duration":"#3:17","title":"Lodi","transition":"%"},{"duration":"4:42","title":"Can't Pay The Price","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:36","title":"Henry","transition":"%"},{"duration":"5:05","title":"Portland Woman","transition":"%"},{"duration":"2:51","title":"Truck Drivin' Man","transition":"%"},{"duration":"6:16","title":"Last Lonely Eagle","transition":"%"},{"duration":"4:56","title":"Workin' Man Blues","transition":"%"},{"duration":"#4:13","title":"Cecelia","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:32","title":"Louisiana Lady","transition":"%"},{"duration":"#6:53","title":"The Weight"}]},{"number":3,"songs":[{"title":"[1:55:44]","transition":";"},{"duration":"7:57","title":"Easy Wind","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:10]","transition":"%"},{"duration":"2:41","title":"Mama Tried","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:11]","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:38","title":"Cold Rain And Snow","transition":"%"},{"duration":"6:43","title":"Attics Of My Life","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:27]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:17","title":"China Cat Sunflower","transition":">"},{"duration":"2:16","title":"Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"4:22","title":"I Know You Rider","transition":"%"},{"duration":"7:39","title":"High Time","transition":"%"},{"duration":"11:30","title":"It's A Man's, Man's, Man's World (1)","transition":"%","commentRef":"1"},{"title":"[0:50]","transition":"%"},{"duration":"2:04","title":"Cryptical Envelopment","transition":">"},{"duration":"8:32","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"7:40","title":"The Other One","transition":">"},{"duration":"2:57","title":"Me And My Uncle","transition":">"},{"duration":"1:14","title":"The Other One","transition":">"},{"duration":"12:31","title":"Dancing In The Street","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:22]","transition":";"},{"duration":"15:10","title":"Turn On Your Lovelight","transition":">"},{"duration":"0:42","title":"Saint Stephen Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"10:00","title":"Turn On Your Lovelight","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:30]"}]},{"number":"encore","songs":[{"title":"[6:31]","transition":";"},{"duration":"6:31","title":"Uncle John's Band"}]}],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Fillmore East","city":"New York","state":"NY","date":"1970-07-12T07:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1970s/19700712.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"Total time 2:47:49.

SET 1 is acoustic Dead.  The tape containing the timed tunes usually circulates as unidentified filler, but a few copies bear this date, which seems plausible.  Someone shouts for Kesey before Let Me In, which produces a mocking comment from Phil; the vibe strongly suggests the Fillmore West.  DeadBase IX lists a Casey Jones for this date.  Set 2 was a NRPS set and SET 3 was electric dead.  There is a review of this show by Michael Lydon posted on the Rolling Stone website.  The untimed tunes are from the review.Teddy GoodBear and Dave Tamarkin strongly dissent from this dating of the tape.  They point out that the best copies they've located appear as filler on Ken Leigh's NYC area AUD masters.  They believe that this tape is probably Ken's master from a show in fall '70 in the NYC area.  They may be correct.\"Grateful Dead I Have Known,\" by Ed McClanahan (Playboy, March 72), is based on this run of shows.

Set 1 is acoustic Dead, perhaps the complete set (though the AUD in circulation is missing most of Swing Low).  The tape begins with Truckin', which has a piano loud in the PA mix; this is halted after 18 seconds by Garcia's shouts of \"Hold it!  Monitors!  We won't play without the monitors.\"  During the following banter Phil proposes \"If you got a yellow dog bring him up here and we'll screw him.\"  When they restart Truckin' Garcia calls out over its opening \"Bring the piano down!\" and it comes down in the PA mix over the next 20 seconds or so.  Pigpen also plays piano on Brokedown Palace and Box Of Rain.  David Nelson plays mandolin on Dark Hollow, Friend Of The Devil, Ripple, Rosalie McFall, Cold Jordan and Swing Low.  Jerry plays pedal steel guitar and someone plays fiddle on Box Of Rain.Set 2 is the beginning of the NRPS set.  We must be missing at least another half dozen songs or so to make up the complete set.  Probably the rest of the set exists on the AUD masters.Set 3 is electric Dead, the conclusion of the show; probably this was preceded by at least a few more electric tunes.  This is one of the major Dark Stars of the year.  There is a Tighten Up Jam starting around 18:00 minutes in to Dark Star.  About 3 minutes after the 2nd Drums in Good Lovin' Phil trios with the drummers for a minute or so.This is a listenable AUD tape, mastered by Jack Toner on a Sony T-110 cassette deck; the mics are a ways back in the hall but the band is still decently audible and the audience noise is miraculously minimal for the venue.  Most circulating copies are missing the opening 0:28 of the Dark Star; some are missing the last 0:37 of Good Lovin', but complete copies also circulate.It seems probable that much more of this show exists on the AUD masters than is presently circulating or cataloged here (10/00).  It would be nice to bring them into circulation complete.

Timings are from the AUD tape supplemented by the SBD.  See Comments under 9/17/70 on the structure of this show.Set 1 is acoustic Dead.  Pigpen plays piano on Truckin'.  David Nelson plays mandolin on Black Peter.  During Black Peter, after \"Go beneath the ground,\" Jerry stops the song cold, saying (in his most serious voice) \"Hold it.  This is insane, man.  I'm sorry but it's just horrible up here.  Really awful.\"  Compare the previous night's false start of Truckin'.  This time, though, they decide to abort the acoustic set and move directly to NRPS set, which is why this NRPS set is so long.Set 2 is NRPS with Garcia, pedal steel guitar.  This is probably the complete set.  Bobby is featured vocalist on The Race Is On, Mama Tried and Sawmill.Set 3 is an electric Dead set, probably complete.  The first 15 seconds of Casey Jones are clipped on the circulating AUD tape.  There are speed glitches on the master during the first Cryptical produced by the deck being jostled as someone passes; this problem recurs at several points during the set.  In the pause before Dancin one of the drummers starts the Not Fade drum pattern and then pulls up short after one round when the band doesn't follow -- \"Aw, no dice\" is the taper's comment.  There is a Tighten Up Jam starting about 9 minutes in to Dancin'.  There is a cut in the AUD tape's Saint Stephen starting at 3:29; approximately 40 seconds are missing here -- probably a tape flip.  The Jam out of Not Fade Away starts teasing Goin' Down The Road early on but never resolves into it either before or after a fairly developed Bid You Goodnight Jam.  For the first 1:02 after the Good Lovin' Drums Phil solos with the drummers.  The demonstration demanding an encore goes on over the Youngblood's version of Get Together playing on the PA.Jack Toner mastered the circulating audience cassette source.  This AUD master makes decent listening, especially the electric Dead set.  The mics aren't right up front but they're not as far back in the hall as on 9/17/70 so the tape has better saturation and presence, and the audience noise isn't much worse.The 80 minute SBD in circulation contains Truckin', Peter, and Me & My Uncle through the encore.  The FM-SBD contains Me & My Uncle through the encore.. SBD TAPES OF THE SEPTEMBER 1970 FILLMORE EAST SHOWSAs they did in February and May '70, enterprising Fillmore East stagecrew patched a reel-to-reel deck under the stage into the PA feed and made SBD masters of the September '70 Fillmore East run.  It is not clear how much of the run they managed to master.  At present (10/00) no SBD tape from 9/17/70 has emerged into circulation but this does not mean that no masters exist.  Several years ago about 50 minutes of SBD excerpts from the 9/18/70 electric Dead set (Operator through the encore) came into circulation, initially as FM-SBD broadcast by David Gans.  During the same period approximately 70 minutes of SBD excerpts from the 9/19/70 electric Dead set came into circulation in the same fashion.  Two SBD cassettes from 9/20/70 have been in circulation for more than 20 years; they contain both the acoustic and electric Dead sets nearly complete but nothing of the NRPS set.  Recently a lower gen copy of these tapes have come into circulation (see Comments under 9/20/70).Much of this run of shows has not yet emerged into circulation on SBD tape.  To judge from the nearly complete SBD of 5/15/70 made by the same tapers, it seems plausible to think that all four September shows were taped in their entirety, including the NRPS sets.  Whatever these masters contain, they are not in the vault; they are said to reside on the East Coast.Eaton lists:09/18/70 The Fillmore East, New York City Ny - xcerpt  4.8, 061min, Sbd, A1D3, Reel M->Reel 1->Dat 3, 44k,  7inch Master Reels@7.5ips 1/2trk->1st Gen Reel->Dat x 0->SS->Dat x 2","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-09-18.sbd.reynolds.97525.flac16 "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-09-18.sbd-part.gorinsky.4670.sbeok.shnf "},{"name":" Unknown","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-09-18.bootleg.evans.100.sbeok.shnf "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-09-18.sbd-aud.cotsman.17893.sbeok.shnf "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-09-18.set2.aud-sbd.sirmick.sbeok.30882.flacf "}],"recordings":"180 A?  45 A?  80 SB  50 FMMaster recording source(s): 7inch Master Reels@7.5ips 1/2trk","contributors":["Jim Powell  Alan Mande  Dick Latvala  David Gans  Dwight Holmes  Jim Wise  Bill Gadsden"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"title":"[47:14]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:44","title":"Don't Ease Me In","transition":"%"},{"duration":"6:06","title":"Candyman","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:58]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:32","title":"Silver Threads And Golden Needle","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:39","title":"Friend Of The Devil","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:30]","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:50","title":"Deep Elem Blues","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:00","title":"The Rub","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:29]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:00","title":"Rosalie McFall","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:10]","transition":"%"},{"duration":"4:51","title":"Cumberland Blues","transition":"%"},{"duration":"6:01","title":"New Speedway Boogie","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:06]","transition":"%"},{"duration":"5:45","title":"To Lay Me Down","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:04]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:20","title":"Cold Jordan","transition":">"},{"duration":"2:50","title":"Swing Low Sweet Chariot"}]},{"number":2,"songs":[{"title":"[54:55]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:56","title":"Workin' Man Blues","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:46","title":"I Don't Know You","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:08]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:32","title":"Superman","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:14]","transition":";"},{"duration":"4:10","title":"Whatcha Gonna Do","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:10]","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:14","title":"Portland Woman","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:04]","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:06]","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:08","title":"Glendale Train","transition":"%"},{"duration":"4:10","title":"Fair Chance To Know","transition":"%"},{"duration":"7:37","title":"All I Ever Wanted","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:16]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:38","title":"Henry","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:37","title":"Lodi","transition":"%"},{"duration":"6:42","title":"Last Lonely Eagle","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:03]","transition":"%"},{"title":"Honky Tonk Women"}]},{"number":3,"songs":[{"title":"[1:47:16]","transition":";"},{"duration":"11:04","title":"Morning Dew","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:27","title":"Me And My Uncle","transition":"%"},{"duration":"10:04","title":"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl","transition":"%"},{"duration":"5:51","title":"Cold Rain And Snow","transition":"%"},{"duration":"8:47","title":"Easy Wind","transition":"%"},{"duration":"4:25","title":"Sugar Magnolia","transition":"%"},{"duration":"25:24","title":"Dark Star","transition":">"},{"duration":"6:18","title":"Saint Stephen","transition":">"},{"duration":"0:36","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"4:46","title":"Not Fade Away","transition":">"},{"duration":"0:53","title":"Darkness Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"0:40","title":"China Cat Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"0:42","title":"Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"1:48","title":"Not Fade Away","transition":">"},{"duration":"20:22","title":"Turn On Your Lovelight","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:32]"}]}],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Fillmore East","city":"New York","state":"NY","date":"1970-09-19T07:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1970s/19700919.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"Total time  3:29:33+.

See Comments under 9/17/70 on the structure of this show.    SET 1 is acoustic Dead, the complete set.  David Grisman plays mandolin on Friend Of The Devil, David Nelson joins with another mandolin on Big Railroad Blues; both continue through Ripple.  There is a hint of harmonica on Dark Hollow, presumably Pigpen's.  The instrumentation on To Lay Me Down is hard to figure but the electric guitar is probably Bobby and Jim Wise may be right that the piano is Jerry on this tune.  The piano on Truckin' is Pigpen, however.  Nelson & Grisman return on mandolin for Rosalie McFall.  Jerry switches to electric guitar for Cumberland and New Speedway, then back to acoustic for Brokedown Palace.  Pigpen plays piano again on this tune.SET 2 is the only NRPS tune from this show to make it into circulation so far.SET 3 is an electric Dead set.  There was also a NRPS set between the acoustic and electric Dead sets but tape hasn't surfaced.  Candyman cuts in at \"Good morning Mr. Benson.\"  The #3:31 of tape from the conclusion of Good Lovin' that has always criculated as part of this tape (between Sittin' On Top Of The World and Big Boy Pete) turns out to be the last 3:31 of the 9/18/70 Good Lovin'.During the Jam out of Not Fade Away Jerry feints at Goin' Down The Road and Mountain Jam but settles into neither before transiting into the Bid You Goodnight Jam.  This Caution has few rivals from any year, and the Feedback that follows is \"buzz-saw music\" at its best.SBD cassette tapes of the acoustic and electric Dead sets of this show have been circulating since the mid-70s at the latest.  Reportedly there is an AUD of the acoustic set.  Recently Bill Gadsden, Jim Wise and others put a clean copy of 1st gen reels into circulation on CDs.  They sound great (and add the one NRPS tune).

SET 1 is the electric Dead set.  According to Dave Tamarkin, who attended and taped this show, the entire electric segment was all one set, with a long pause to correct technical difficulties between Good Lovin' and Alligator.The first 3:10 of the Jam after Alligator is just Jerry & the drummers; this Jam involves allusions to Not Fade Away, Goin' Down The Road, The Other One and Caution, but never settles into any steady riff despite the drummers energetic efforts to herd it into Not Fade from 7:30 on -- when they finally do slip into it by the back door at 10:39 the effect is explosive.  The dovetail into Goin' Down The Road 3 minutes later is as deft; this version features the additional verse \"Mama told me son don't go down there.\"  There are Caution hints in the transition from Mountain Jam back to Not Fade.  Pigpen's harmonica is prominent early in Caution -- the Jamming here is over the top, the segue into Lovelight takes it from a roar to a whisper to a roar in 3 seconds. It's hard to believe they didn't play an encore, or two.We now have Jack Warner's 4-CD composite of this show.

This is superior to the version Teddy Goodbear and his buddy put into circulation a couple years ago.  I believe Jim Wise had a hand in re-transcribing the tapes.\"TAPES OF 11/6/70There is no SBD master of this show in the vault.  There are parts of three AUD masters from this show in circulation.1AUD:  The so-called \"usher\" tape, made by an usher at the venue, Ken Leigh, on a Sony T-110 cassette deck, from the center loge.  Circulating copies of this master include the soundcheck; the acoustic Dead set through El Paso, which breaks off after 2:08, (sometimes also a tag end of Uncle John's Band); the complete NRPS set; and the complete electric set complete.  This master tends to include tunings between songs.  It is a good job of AUD taping for the period.  There is a cut in Lovelight at 7:30, at the tape flip.2AUD:  The circulating segment of this master contains I'm A King Bee through Sugar Magnolia.  This master is easily distinguished by the guy yelping just off mic immediately before the beginning of the first Truckin' vocals.  This master is almost as good as 1AUD; it may be Marty Weinberg's.  It tends to clip out pauses between tunes.  Whoever made this tape, it would be useful to turn up the rest of it.  At the end of the cassette Side A of this tape there is a copy of the Easy Wind from the AUD of 7/10/70 after I Know You Rider; this tune has sometimes been mistakenly thought to belong to 11/6/70.  (Marty Weinberg probably mastered 7/10/70 AUD.)3AUD:  This tape supplies the conclusion of the acoustic set -- #El Paso (the last #2:37), Brokedown, Uncle John -- used to patch some copies of 1AUD.  It was mastered by Dave Tamarkin with a Sony dictaphone -- his first show and his first effort as a taper.  Copies of the complete acoustic set in this master also circulate.  It is a mediocre AUD tape with lots of audience noise & tinny sound.Recently Teddy GoodBear & David Tamarkin assembled a 4-CD set of this show using a 2nd gen copy of 1AUD, with the acoustic set patched with 3AUD.  This 4-CD set includes the NRPS set, now circulating for the first time.  Another set is in preparation, from tape transcripts assembled by Jim Wise and with production work by Jack Warner, which will comprise first generation copies of this material (1/01).","downloadSources":[{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-11-06.aud.evans.3338.sbefail.shnf "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-11-06.aud.weinberg.moore-berger.119818.flac16 "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-11-06.aud.warner.17183.sbeok.shnf "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-11-06.d3new.hanno.19922.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"250 AF  50 AF  72 A?","contributors":["Jim Powell  Dave Tamarkin  Jack Warner  Frank Venezia  Jim Wise  Joseph Jupille  Teddy GoodBear  David Minches"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"title":"[37:09]","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:27","title":"Deep Elem Blues","transition":"%"},{"duration":"1:36","title":"Monkey And The Engineer","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:39","title":"Big Railroad Blues","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:11","title":"Operator","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:16]","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:11","title":"El Paso","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:19","title":"How Long Blues","transition":"%"},{"duration":"4:21","title":"Ripple","transition":"%"},{"duration":"4:19","title":"Brokedown Palace","transition":">"},{"duration":"5:35","title":"Uncle John's Band"}]},{"number":2,"songs":[{"title":"[42:14]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:22","title":"Truck Drivin' Man","transition":"%"},{"duration":"2:14","title":"Together Again Instrumental","transition":"%"},{"duration":"1:40","title":"Sweet Lovin One False Start","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:22]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:38","title":"Sweet Lovin One","transition":"%"},{"duration":"10:20","title":"Dirty Business","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:05]","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:37","title":"Henry","transition":"%"},{"duration":"6:22","title":"Last Lonely Eagle","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:53","title":"Connection","transition":"%"},{"duration":"2:30","title":"Louisiana Lady","transition":"%"},{"duration":"5:04","title":"Honky Tonk Women"}]},{"number":3,"songs":[{"title":"[[58:11 +]]","transition":";"},{"title":"[58:11 +]  [0:59  Intro]","transition":";"},{"duration":"4:02","title":"Cumberland Blues","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:18]","transition":";"},{"duration":"6:02","title":"Cold Rain And Snow","transition":";"},{"duration":"4:22","title":"It Hurts Me Too","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:15]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:35","title":"Beat It On Down The Line","transition":"%"},{"duration":"6:47","title":"Truckin'","transition":">"},{"duration":"16:27","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"9:56","title":"The Other One","transition":">"},{"duration":"4:38","title":"Casey Jones","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:00]"}]}],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Capitol Theater","city":"Port Chester","state":"NY","date":"1970-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1970s/19701107.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"See Comments under 11/05/70 on the structure of these shows.SET 1 is the acoustic Dead set.

Total time  3:11:01 +.  This list appears to be complete, with the possible exception of the NRPS set, and perhaps a final encore.  The timings given here represent a composite of 1AUD and 2AUD.1AUD:  This is Jack Toner's master.  Circulating copies contain the complete acoustic set, the NRPS set except Henry & Last Lonely Eagle, the complete 1st electric set, and Attics through I Know You Rider from the 2nd electric set.  There is a cut in It Hurts Me Too and another, 47 seconds long, in The Other One, starting at 5:56, but the Drums are complete & intact on this tape.  It is missing I'm A King Bee & Good Lovin' and is clipped at the beginnings and ends of many songs.  This master is inferior to 2AUD but its Ripple lacks the other master's annoying chatter and it supplies parts of the show still missing on all circulating copies of 2AUD.  It is weakest during the acoustic set.  The electric sets are B+/A- tape for the period.2AUD:  This is Marty Weinberg's master, onto 7\" Uher reels, from the center loge.  Except for the chatter that mars Ripple and Dirty Business, this is truly an excellent AUD tape.  Circulating copies contain Deep Elem Blues through El Paso from the acoustic set, Dirty Business, Henry, Last Lonely Eagle, Louisiana Lady and Honky Tonk Women from the NRPS set, plus the complete first and second electric sets.  The Drums between Truckin' & The Other One have about 3:30 minutes cut out.  This master includes I'm A King Bee and a complete Good Lovin'.3AUD:  Ken Leigh mastered tape of this show.

Unfortunately, there is no known master       which can provide these pieces.       *A small master tape pause obscures the transition to Dark Star.       No more than a few seconds of music are missing.       *There is a small master reel glitch at 0:40 of Dancin' in the       Streets.       ***Caveat emptor: I have tried to be fairly thorough, but there       may be a few other small anomalies on this recording.  We are       after all talking about an audience recording from 1970.***TAPES OF 11/8/70Since no SBD survives in the vault of this alltime classic show we are especially lucky that there are parts of four AUD masters in circulation.  The best master as far as sound, 1AUD was recorded from the balcony by Marty Weinberg with a Uher reel-to-reel deck.  It is recognizable by the following defects:  The 1AUD acoustic set master is missing Dire Wolf and I Know You Rider entirely (many copies of this master patch these tunes in from 2AUD or from 4AUD, others don't).  All copies of 1AUD are missing nearly all the pauses between songs in the acoustic, including part of the Godzilla discussion and a number of other comments from the band; these cuts are on the master, the results of Weinberg's characteristically heavy hand on the pause button.  The 1AUD master of the electric set is missing the opening 1:46 of Morning Dew, the 1st 9 seconds of Around And Around, 1:02 of Jamming in It's All Over Now, Baby Blue starting at 7:37, the first 3 seconds of Truckin', the first couple seconds of Dark Star, and 4:19 of Jamming from Dancin, starting at 2:06.  (Some copies in circulation patch the beginning of Morning Dew with 2AUD; some patch the middle of Dancin with 2AUD, and of these some return to 1AUD for the last 3:56 of Dancin and others continue with 2AUD through to the end of the song.  Also, many circulating tapes that start with 1AUD and patch through to the end with 2AUD continue through to the end of the show with 2AUD's version of the concluding sequence, NFA through Good Lovin', despite the fact that 2AUD's GDTRFB is missing fully 3 minutes of Jamming starting at 4:12..)The 2AUD master was recorded by Ken Leigh with a Sony TC-110 with a built in mic, also apparently from the balcony.  Besides this cut in GDTRFB, which includes the brief Mountain Jam, the 2AUD master of this sequence is distinguished by a woman saying \"hey, more\" during the opening NFA Drums.  2AUD has more audience noise than 1AUD.  It is not widely circulated except fragmentarily as patches in Dew and Dancin on copies of 1AUD, but the complete acoustic set and all of the electric set except New Orleans > Searchin and Truckin' through Dancin can be found; there is no sign of the NRPS set in 2AUD.  The 2AUD acoustic set tape contains the entire set continuously, including the Space between songs and makes a better way to listen to this brilliant set.  The I Know You Rider has 1:40 cut starting around 3:00.  All circulating copies of 2AUD are missing the last minute plus of Uncle John's Band; some copies patch this in from 1AUD but many don't.  Clearly on several occasions people have taken partial or complete versions of 1AUD and 2AUD and assembled various combinations of the two tapes to make more nearly complete versions of the show -- other combinations besides those noted above.3AUD has only recently come into circulation.  It was made on a Sony dictaphone but apparently not by Dave Tamarkin, though perhaps by his brother Jeff; its sound quality improves as it progresses; probably the mic was moved closer to the PA in the course of the performance.  3AUD contains only the electric set; it is the only master that includes the opening 3 seconds of Truckin' and the first bar of NFA; it is missing 0:47 of Good Lovin' starting 5:40 after Drums [4:07].  Most circulating copies of 1AUD require speed correction, whereas copies of 3AUD are more likely to be good speed.4AUD is represented in circulation only by Dire Wolf and I Know You Rider, used to patch some old copies of the 1AUD acoustic set.  The 4AUD I Know You Rider is complete, whereas the 2AUD Rider has 1:40 cut starting around 3:00.  4AUD's I Know You Rider lacks this cut, and so includes additional vocals and an extended guitar solo.  It is possible that some patches on old copies of 1AUD which are assumed to be from 2AUD are in fact from 4AUD.  It would be great to turn up the complete master of this tape.On the best AUD master right before Casey Jones a guy near the mic (the taper?) says \"It's going to be a night full of surprises\" and a woman says back \"really!\" like she knows it & she's stoked to the max.  I'd love to meet her.","downloadSources":[{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-11-08.aud.garrett-evans.3339.shnf "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-11-08.aud.lee.pcrp.26975.shnf "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-11-08.aud.weinberg.moore-berger.119787.flac16 "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-11-08.aud.weiner.28609.sbeok.shnf "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-11-08.aud-weinberg.cousinit.18639.shnf "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-11-08.partial.aud.unknown.fix-28609.94500.flac16 "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-11-08.aud.owens.23474.sbeok.shnf "},{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-11-08.aud.warner.17184.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"250 AF  135 A?  135 A?  10 A?","contributors":["Jim Powell  Tim Anderson  Robert Blakeslee Gilpin  Dwight Holmes  Jack Warner"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"title":"[32:10]","transition":";"},{"duration":"6:04","title":"Attics Of My Life","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:08]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:27","title":"Mama Tried","transition":"%"},{"duration":"4:52","title":"Walking The Dog","transition":"%"},{"duration":"3:40","title":"New Minglewood Blues","transition":";"},{"duration":"8:56","title":"Morning Dew","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:56","title":"Deep Elem Blues"}]}],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Action House","city":"Island Park","state":"NY","date":"1970-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1970s/19701109.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"Most copies of this tape in circulation have a curious glitch:  the Attics plays through almost the whole of its length and then restarts.

If there was a setbreak it probably came after Good Lovin', or possibly after Cumberland.  Jack Casady & Jorma Kaukonen enter to hoots & hollers about 2 minutes into Goin' Down The Road, Papa John Creach immediately afterward, and they continue on stage throughout the rest of the show; Jorma takes lead vocals on Uncle Sam Blues and Come Back Baby.  There was also a NRPS set.There is a brief Saint Stephen Jam starting 7:30 into Hard To Handle.  Early in Jam1 there are references to Hey Bo Diddley and Who Do You Love; around 3:20 Jerry riffs on Nobody's Fault in quadruple time.  Around 6:30 into this Jam a riff resembling Tequila shows up, anticipating Jam2, which returns to this figure several times.  There is a break in the tape 41 seconds after the last Drums but fair continuity in the Jam; 20-40 seconds at most are lost in this lacunaThe first 110 minutes of the recording are not too bad; thereafter the sound quality deteriorates severely (the 2nd 90-minute tape starts with Drums > Good Lovin').  Reportedly, the master was made by one Mike Tannenbaum on reels concealed in a wheelchair at the center of the 5th row (the back of the orchestra pit?) ; the first 90 minutes of the tape sound consistent with this; during the 2nd tape it sounds as if the taper perhaps got swarmed when the crowd got up & thereafter his mics were muffled by surrounding bodies, but there are also other problems with the second 90 minutes of this tape, among them pitch problems perhaps caused by the deck bouncing with the dancing floorboards.

It is not clear where the good Lovin fits nor how much more might have been played than appears on these tapes.In the pause before Mama Tried Bobby sings The Frozen Logger off mic.  The alternating harmonica and organ on Truckin' > Other One is Pigpen.  Winwood sits in on organ on Hard To Handle, Big RR and Not Fade > Goin' Down > Not Fade.  The harmonica on Big Railroad Blues may not be Pigpen.  It's probably Chris Wood who takes the first vocals on Not Fade Away and is audible intermittantly throughout the following sequence.  Uncle John's Band has a brief prelude jam with Will Scarlet on harmonica.  Uncle John's sounds like an encore; Bobby says \"See y'all later\" afterward.  Nearly all of China Cat Sunflower is missing on the SBD tape.Recently Bill Gadsden, Jim Wise and Frank Venezia put an 85-minute 2-CD set into circulation containing a fresh transcript of a 1st gen reel of this SBD, including a more nearly complete version of Hard To Handle.  Previously, this tape circulated for years in a completely scrambled sequence (created when it was transferred from reels to cassette).  There is also a 24 minute very lo gen SBD tape containing Mama Tried, Truckin' > Other One, and Uncle John.According to Corry Arnold on 11/14/70 at the Fillmore East after Frank Zappa's performance Grace Slick came on stage and announced on behalf of Bill Graham that the Dead and the Airplane would be playing a surprise concert at the Fillmore East on Monday, November 16th.  On the 16th the very pregnant Slick was unable to make the gig but Hot Tuna substituted for the Airplane.  This is why this show does not appear in ads and playbills etc.Richard Volet writes:  \"Fillmore East, fall 1970 (maybe earlier that year?) Before Mickey Hart left, after T.C. left. The concert was originally billed as Airplane/Dead, but the Airplane broke up right then (I believe that week) and Hot Tuna took their place. I remember Hot Tuna playing with Will Scarlet on Harmonica, but I think without Papa John Creach. The New Riders played next, with Garcia on pedal steel.  The Dead set included Dear Mr. Fantasy with Stevie Winwood on vocal and organ, and guest appearance also of Tom Constanten on Dark Star/Saint Stephen. This was with two drummmers.  (I also remember Garcia playing a Gibson SG and weir playing a hollow body Guild.) \"See Comments on 11/23/70.A SBD Traffic set from Fillmore East 11/23/70 is also in circulation.","downloadSources":[{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-11-16.sbd.112987.flac "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-11-16.sbd.winters.17361.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"9:20 A?","contributors":["Jim Powell  Adrian M.

The circulating AUD tape was mastered by Marty Weinberg on 7\" Uher reels.  As customarily with Weinberg's masters, there are usually pauses on the tape between songs.  This makes it impossible to prove the sequence of tunes from this master, and there is some confusion about the correct order of songs.  On most circulating cassettes the Good Lovin' sequence is placed last, after Uncle John's Band on the second half of side B of the second 90-minute cassette, presumably to keep from breaking it over a cassette side when transcribing from reels.  After Mama Tried seems the likeliest spot where it belongs, but there is no proof.  After Casey Jones Jerry says \"We're gonna take a little break.\"  Probably the preceding was all one set, but it is possible there was another break earlier.Jorma Kaukonen plays throughout SET 2.  The Instrumental following All Over Now is his.  Jack Casady joins on bass starting with the Jam into Darling Carey.  It's Marmaduke on vocals in Darling Carey.  Many cassettes have the order of these two Jams reversed -- again, presumably to avoid splitting the longer one over a flip (and again, no proof that the sequnce listed is correct).","downloadSources":[{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-11-20.aud.cotsman.9001.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"167 AF","contributors":["Jim Powell  Gordon Sharpless  Rob Berger  Jim Wise  Dwight Holmes"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"title":"[20:59]","transition":";"},{"duration":"1:50","title":"Cryptical Envelopment","transition":">"},{"duration":"0:07#","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"7:19","title":"The Other One","transition":">"},{"duration":"5:29","title":"Cryptical Envelopment","transition":">"},{"duration":"6:14","title":"Cosmic Charlie"}]}],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Sargent Gym - Boston University","city":"Boston","state":"MA","date":"1970-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1970s/19701121.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"Before That's It For The Other One DeadBase IX lists  Casey Jones, Candyman, Mama Tried, Easy Wind, Saint Stephen; and following Cosmic Charlie it lists  Uncle John's Band.

Andrew Smith, who attended the show, confirms that this concert consisted of a single NRPS set followed by a single long electric Dead set.  Most circulating tapes have the contents re-arranged somewhat, presumably to fit onto cassettes from reel masters.  SET 1 is NRPS with Garcia, pedal steel.  Besides the stub-end of Louisiana Lady and the clips between songs this appears to be the complete set.SET 2 is this single long electric Dead set, complete except for clips between songs, a cut in Dew at 7:17, a cut in the Jam out of Truckin' at 6:52, a very brief cut (probably a drop-out) at 12:29 into The Other One, and two cuts in the Not Fade Away sequence.  It's possible the opening Drums of Good Lovin' have been clipped on the circulating tape but this Good Lovin' doesn't have a drum duo in the usual place either -- the drummers start one their duo at the regular spot (2:04) but Jerry just keeps on Jamming and after a few seconds the rest of the band kicks in behind him too.  This monster Good Lovin' is also interesting for the way it anticipates the Pigpen rap versions of '71.The tape cuts just as they are going into the Goin' Down The Road theme at 5:00, and resumes seven seconds later during the final vocals of this tune, passing into the Bid You Jam that usually concludes the tune within about a minute -- that is, we are missing most of the song, several minutes at the least.  After just 29 seconds of Not Fade Reprise Jamming, Jerry takes this into a unique little Jam that lasts for 51 seconds and then shifts back to Not Fade.  The tape cuts for good 1:20 later, during the beginning of the Not Fade vocals Reprise.  Altogether we must be missing at least 5-6 minutes from this sequence.This is a high energy show in many respects.  Jerry seems unusually keyed up.  It's not too bad a job of AUD taping, either, though not optimal by any means.  The mics probably moved closer to the PA between the NRPS and electric sets.  Thereafter the mics sound like they're not too far back in the hall -- they are fairly well-saturated but there's still some hall resonance and bass boom; audience noise isn't too bad.","downloadSources":[{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-11-29.aud.hanno.7592.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"164 A?","contributors":["Jim Powell  Andrew Smith[vbcrlf][vbcrlf]"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}},{"sets":[{"number":1,"songs":[{"title":"[40:56]","transition":";"},{"duration":"#2:39","title":"Me And My Uncle","transition":";"},{"duration":"1:25","title":"Loony Tunes Tuning","transition":";"},{"duration":"7:31","title":"Truckin'","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:34]","transition":";"},{"duration":"6:09","title":"Brokedown Palace (1)","transition":";","commentRef":"1"},{"title":"[2:20]","transition":";"},{"duration":"6:54","title":"Hard To Handle","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:23]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:28","title":"Mama Tried","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:15]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:57","title":"China Cat Sunflower","transition":">"},{"duration":"3:03","title":"Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"4:07","title":"I Know You Rider","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:09]"}]},{"number":2,"songs":[{"title":"[1:18:44]","transition":";"},{"duration":"#4:28","title":"Big Railroad Blues","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:37]","transition":";"},{"duration":"8:15","title":"I'm A King Bee","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:09]","transition":";"},{"duration":"5:43","title":"Sugar Magnolia","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:24]","transition":"%"},{"duration":"4:26","title":"Casey Jones","transition":"%"},{"title":"[0:08]","transition":";"},{"duration":"3:41","title":"Dire Wolf","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:31]","transition":";"},{"duration":"2:03","title":"Cryptical Envelopment","transition":">"},{"duration":"1:33","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"8:43#","title":"The Other One","transition":"%"},{"duration":"#4:18","title":"Not Fade Away","transition":">"},{"duration":"4:51","title":"Goin' Down The Road Feeling Bad","transition":">"},{"duration":"0:23","title":"Not Fade Away","transition":">"},{"duration":"1:46","title":"Darkness Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"1:02","title":"Saint Stephen Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"0:23","title":"Space Jam","transition":">"},{"duration":"1:44","title":"Not Fade Away","transition":";"},{"title":"[1:17]","transition":";"},{"duration":"1:53","title":"Good Lovin'","transition":">"},{"duration":"1:11","title":"Drums","transition":">"},{"duration":"11:46","title":"Good Lovin'","transition":">"},{"duration":"7:31","title":"Uncle John's Band","transition":";"},{"title":"[0:08]"}]}],"band":"Grateful Dead","venue":"Sonoma County Fairgrounds","city":"Santa Rosa","state":"CA","date":"1970-12-12T08:00:00.000Z","posterLink":"http://www.deadlists.com/posters/1970s/19701212.jpg","ticketLinks":{"ticketsList":[],"passesList":[]},"comments":"Total time 1:59:40 +.

Two separate tapes make up the circulating recordings from this show.  Video of the concert was broadcast by KQED-TV San Francisco with the first 4 songs simulcast on KSAN-FM San Francisco.  KQED-TV station ID before Sugar Magnolia.  The circulating tape of these tunes is the AUD tape; on the circulating tape there is a cut in Monkey And The Engineer at around 1:00 and Easy Wind breaks off about 3 minutes before its conclusion.  According to DeadBase IX a Me And My Uncle followed Easy Wind; but if so there is no trace of it on circulating tape.  This tape is actually from the audience tape whose tapers are apprehended between Sugar Mag and China Cat; it is quite an excellent AUD tape.  It was recorded on Sony ECM-22P mics into a Sony 770 1/4-track reel recorder at 7.5 ips by the same night crew that did the El Monte '70 tapes, the Hollywood Palladium 8/71 AUDs, 7/1/73 -- who was that Masked Man?The other tape in circulation is a pre-broadcast SBD from KQED-TV; it picks up with Big Railroad Blues.  In the pause before Dire Wolf they Tease Cryptical repeatedly.  The Other One goes directly into Black Peter, entirely eliding the Cryptical Envelopment Reprise and Jam.  In the interval between Sugar Mag and China Cat a taper in the audience is busted, with Phil directing a spotlight upon him.  In the background of the China Cat > Rider that follows, but definitely on mic, there is a lady screaming out of control -- she sounds very dosed, spun out hard, and at the moment not really having that much fun.  She screws up the recording of China Cat > Rider pretty good and continues some in the pause that follows, where there's also a woman on mic looking for her cape -- plainly things were a little out of control backstage; perhaps there was a mic live that shouldn't have been somewhere backstage or in the wings.The show-concluding Good Lovin' > Uncle John's Band that follows is an alltime classic.  It used to circulate as Side B of a cassette whose Side A contained the last 45 minutes of Fillmore West 6/7/69, with the concluding Lovelight with Janis breaking off before the end, and sometimes this Good Lovin' > Uncle John was erroneously labeled \"6/7/69\" (nearly 6 months before the tune's premier!).  Where versions of Good Lovin' earlier in the year have a passage of Drums, here the drummers move to the foreground and Jerry and Phil take turns discreetly Jamming with them for about 4 minutes before the whole band resumes Jamming at full blast.  And like the Good Lovin's of 11/29/70 and 12/28/70, this one anticipates the Pigpen rap arrangement of spring '71.Eaton lists:12/31/70 WInterland Arena, San Francisco Ca - xcerpt  4.8, 045min, Sbd, A1D0, Reel M->Cass 1->Dat 0, 48k,  7inch Master Reels@7.5ips 1/2trk->Tascam 122mkIII Cass 1st Gen->3800 x 0After the end of the Dead's set, Weir and Hot Tuna came out and played a short Jam session.  Will Scarlet is said to be the harmonica player.  Tunes played are Johnny B. Goode, Around And Around, Rock Me Baby, Not Fade Away, and I Know You Rider (in Jorma's arrangement).  There is a SBD cassette side in circulation.  The performances are not very exciting.","downloadSources":[{"name":"Audience","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-12-31.sonyecm22p.kaslow-todd.berger.101530.flac16 "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-12-31.aftershow.sbd.cole.6171.sbeok.shnf "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-12-31.sbd.hollister-ayers.106.shnf "},{"name":"Soundboard","href":"http://www.archive.org/details/gd70-12-31.sbd-fm.7283.sbeok.shnf "}],"recordings":"24 AF  90 SBMaster recording source(s): 7inch Master Reels@7.5ips 1/2trk","contributors":["Jim Powell  Rob Bertrando  Dave Litfin  Michael Parrish[vbcrlf][vbcrlf][vbcrlf]"],"caretaker":{"name":"Jim Powell","email":"post to the list"}}]
